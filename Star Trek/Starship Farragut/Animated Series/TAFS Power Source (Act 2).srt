1
00:00:02,692 --> 00:00:05,963
Captain’s Log, stardate: 6050.8.

2
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,722
En route to the Quorus system,

3
00:00:07,765 --> 00:00:11,581
we were intercepted by the Azrael
and fired upon unexpectedly.

4
00:00:11,885 --> 00:00:14,923
The attack was specifically designed
to knock out our warp systems,

5
00:00:14,966 --> 00:00:18,018
which we believe was intended to
delay our reaching the fifth planet.

6
00:00:18,283 --> 00:00:20,074
After relatively quick repairs,

7
00:00:20,117 --> 00:00:24,575
we resumed our original course and
now have arrived at Quorus Five.

8
00:00:24,715 --> 00:00:27,380
The Azrael is holding its
position near the gas giant

9
00:00:27,404 --> 00:00:29,648
and has not made a
move since our arrival.

10
00:00:30,867 --> 00:00:32,012
Magnify.

11
00:00:36,234 --> 00:00:37,769
Amazing!

12
00:00:38,137 --> 00:00:39,429
Fascinating!

13
00:00:39,774 --> 00:00:41,373
Analysis, RT.

14
00:00:41,713 --> 00:00:45,382
Those devices seem to be using the
entire planet as a source of fuel

15
00:00:45,406 --> 00:00:48,632
to create a strange type of
energy that I can’t identify.

16
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:52,478
Some residual energy is escaping
the planet’s gravitational pull

17
00:00:52,502 --> 00:00:55,054
and penetrating both
Azrael and Farragut.

18
00:00:55,404 --> 00:00:56,522
Our shields?

19
00:00:56,546 --> 00:00:58,963
They appear to have no effect
on repelling the energy.

20
00:00:59,071 --> 00:01:00,592
What is your threat assessment?

21
00:01:00,742 --> 00:01:03,766
Unknown. This is unlike
anything I’ve seen before.

22
00:01:03,874 --> 00:01:05,504
Our sensors aren’t
picking up anything new

23
00:01:05,571 --> 00:01:06,919
that we haven’t been able to analyze

24
00:01:06,943 --> 00:01:09,098
from top to bottom
from the Azrael feeds.

25
00:01:09,741 --> 00:01:11,021
I was afraid of that.

26
00:01:11,327 --> 00:01:13,605
Hail the Azrael. Let’s
see if they’ll talk.

27
00:01:15,093 --> 00:01:18,033
Farragut to Azrael, do you read?

28
00:01:23,837 --> 00:01:27,864
Sir, I’m getting something...
I mean someone, but...

29
00:01:27,888 --> 00:01:28,949
What is it?

30
00:01:29,101 --> 00:01:33,317
This... person is ordering us
to leave the system immediately.

31
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:34,544
Put me on.

32
00:01:35,651 --> 00:01:39,585
Azrael, this is Captain John
T. Carter of the USS Farragut.

33
00:01:39,651 --> 00:01:41,072
What’s your situation?

34
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:44,626
*This is Commodore Sheila
Johnson of the USS Azrael.*

35
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:48,297
*As I outrank you and, quite frankly,
can outthink and outfight you,*

36
00:01:48,363 --> 00:01:50,975
*I hereby order you to
hightail it out of this system*

37
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:53,503
*before I take measures
to destroy your ship!*

38
00:01:53,511 --> 00:01:54,942
Commodore who?

39
00:01:55,652 --> 00:01:58,466
Look, I don’t care who
the hell you think you are,

40
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:00,979
put me through to
Captain Glenn immediately!

41
00:02:01,213 --> 00:02:04,488
*You have ten minutes to comply
with my order! Azrael out!*

42
00:02:05,767 --> 00:02:08,990
I might be mistaken, but
I don’t recall mention of

43
00:02:09,014 --> 00:02:11,519
a Commodore Johnson
serving on the Azrael.

44
00:02:11,562 --> 00:02:15,112
No, sir. However, there
is an Ensign Sheila Johnson

45
00:02:15,136 --> 00:02:17,216
serving as the ship’s Comm Officer.

46
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:18,666
Ensign?

47
00:02:18,768 --> 00:02:22,287
Captain, the Azrael’s shields are down.

48
00:02:22,435 --> 00:02:24,897
Very odd for a ship
planning to attack us.

49
00:02:25,295 --> 00:02:27,938
Any chance you can pinpoint
Captain Glenn’s location?

50
00:02:28,082 --> 00:02:31,448
I could if we had access
to Glenn’s medical records.

51
00:02:31,671 --> 00:02:34,263
A narrow band sensor array is capable

52
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,288
of picking up a unique bio signature.

53
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,423
Those records would be available
in the Azrael’s databanks.

54
00:02:39,831 --> 00:02:41,005
I should be able to access them

55
00:02:41,029 --> 00:02:43,006
with command level override codes.

56
00:02:43,048 --> 00:02:45,216
If they haven’t locked out access.

57
00:02:45,436 --> 00:02:46,936
Let’s give it a try.

58
00:02:48,799 --> 00:02:50,706
*Access granted.*

59
00:02:50,772 --> 00:02:54,659
Computer, download medical
records for Captain Aaron Glenn

60
00:02:54,725 --> 00:02:56,730
and tie into the ship’s sensor array.

61
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,079
*Working.*

62
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:03,001
*Task complete.*

63
00:03:03,077 --> 00:03:04,685
She’s all yours, RT.

64
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:11,930
Got him. He’s in the
Science Lab on deck five.

65
00:03:13,504 --> 00:03:15,481
Mike, report to the bridge.

66
00:03:15,547 --> 00:03:17,475
We’re beaming over to the Azrael.

67
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:18,889
You’re in command.

68
00:03:18,955 --> 00:03:22,479
Mr. Prescott, meet us in the
transporter room with one of your staff.

69
00:03:34,591 --> 00:03:37,379
Does it seem excessively
hot in here to you, Captain?

70
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:40,249
It must be over forty
degrees Celsius in here.

71
00:03:46,306 --> 00:03:47,865
Intruders!

72
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:48,946
Get them!

73
00:03:49,887 --> 00:03:51,110
Phasers on stun.

74
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,404
Call security!

75
00:03:59,862 --> 00:04:02,677
No affect. Heavy stun.

76
00:04:06,369 --> 00:04:07,848
Did you see their eyes?

77
00:04:08,244 --> 00:04:10,692
It’s a good chance that
the energy from Quorus Five

78
00:04:10,758 --> 00:04:13,730
is causing the abnormal
behaviors and appearances.

79
00:04:13,903 --> 00:04:16,055
And it’s going to
begin affecting us soon.

80
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:18,224
Right, no time to waste.

81
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,921
Let’s get to Glenn and get some answers.

82
00:04:33,288 --> 00:04:35,789
Commander, we’re receiving
another communication

83
00:04:35,813 --> 00:04:39,382
from the alleged “Commodore”
Johnson. Should I respond?

84
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:42,144
No. Maintain communication
silence for the moment

85
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:43,791
while Jack and his team are on board.

86
00:04:44,153 --> 00:04:47,639
Mr. Thelin, is there any
change in the Azrael’s status?

87
00:04:47,998 --> 00:04:50,806
No, sir. It’s... wait a second.

88
00:04:50,816 --> 00:04:52,053
That’s odd.

89
00:04:52,094 --> 00:04:53,147
What is it?

90
00:04:53,277 --> 00:04:56,258
I don’t quite know. My
instruments seem to be acting up.

91
00:04:56,282 --> 00:04:58,822
I’m reading wild
fluctuations in our position.

92
00:04:59,069 --> 00:05:01,432
One second it’s showing
where we’re supposed to be

93
00:05:01,456 --> 00:05:03,700
and the next it has us
somewhere else completely.

94
00:05:03,853 --> 00:05:05,493
It’s not just you.

95
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:08,483
I’m seeing some strange
anomalies here as well.

96
00:05:08,777 --> 00:05:11,377
Every time I try to correct
it, it just goes off again.

97
00:05:19,792 --> 00:05:20,919
Smithfield to Galway.

98
00:05:20,944 --> 00:05:21,993
*Galway here.*

99
00:05:22,017 --> 00:05:23,494
What’s going on down there?

100
00:05:23,518 --> 00:05:25,782
We’re experiencing some
instrumentation failures.

101
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:28,008
I’m registering multiple
failures in most of

102
00:05:28,032 --> 00:05:30,200
the primary, secondary,
and tertiary systems.

103
00:05:30,267 --> 00:05:33,301
But it’s sporadic...
It’s jumping around.

104
00:05:33,325 --> 00:05:35,260
*Run diagnostics on all systems.*

105
00:05:35,284 --> 00:05:37,592
*I want to know why my ship is acting up!*

106
00:05:37,616 --> 00:05:40,925
Diagnostics aren’t working
either. I need your help fast

107
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:43,132
or we’re going to lose
environmental systems too!

108
00:05:44,161 --> 00:05:45,275
On my way.

109
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:47,281
Mr. Thelin, you have the con.

110
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,244
Whoa! What just caused that?

111
00:05:57,268 --> 00:05:59,842
I can’t nail it down.
Every time I try to

112
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:02,585
compensate for one system,
another one goes down.

113
00:06:09,249 --> 00:06:10,992
This is getting us nowhere.

114
00:06:11,448 --> 00:06:12,440
Agreed.

115
00:06:12,613 --> 00:06:14,411
Let’s shut down all systems and

116
00:06:14,477 --> 00:06:16,344
bring them back up under manual control.

117
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,902
We’ll route minimal power to

118
00:06:17,968 --> 00:06:20,868
non-critical systems and lock
them down on a fixed setting.

119
00:06:21,102 --> 00:06:22,724
Alright. Let’s do it.

120
00:06:35,984 --> 00:06:38,974
That seems to have done
the trick... For the moment.

121
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:40,721
Congratulations, Chief.

122
00:06:40,787 --> 00:06:41,837
Thanks.

123
00:06:41,865 --> 00:06:43,361
Don’t get too comfortable though.

124
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,463
I want you to monitor
these systems constantly.

125
00:06:46,487 --> 00:06:50,022
Advise me of anything
unusual. I’ll be on the bridge.

126
00:06:50,088 --> 00:06:51,320
Aye, sir.

127
00:06:56,781 --> 00:07:00,697
Why can’t I solve this? It’s all here...

128
00:07:01,353 --> 00:07:06,287
I have all I need... I
must solve it... I must...

129
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:08,638
Captain Glenn?

130
00:07:11,877 --> 00:07:13,730
And you are...?

131
00:07:13,754 --> 00:07:17,733
Carter, Sir. Captain John T.
Carter of the USS Farragut.

132
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,168
I don’t remember inviting you!

133
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:22,733
Do you want to explain to
me why you fired on my ship?

134
00:07:22,841 --> 00:07:25,700
Nonsense. I didn’t fire on anyone!

135
00:07:25,724 --> 00:07:28,257
And I strongly suggest
that you leave my ship

136
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,826
before I’m forced to
deal with you personally!

137
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:34,217
What’s the big experiment,
Glenn? What are you doing here?

138
00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:36,138
You wouldn’t understand!

139
00:07:37,929 --> 00:07:39,056
RT?

140
00:07:39,148 --> 00:07:42,044
He is tapped into those
devices orbiting Quorus Five.

141
00:07:42,755 --> 00:07:46,115
They appear to be part of a network
of machines all working in concert.

142
00:07:46,181 --> 00:07:48,354
But for what purpose, I can’t say.

143
00:07:48,626 --> 00:07:50,289
Alright, that’s it Glenn.

144
00:07:50,356 --> 00:07:52,679
You will relinquish
command to my Security Chief

145
00:07:52,703 --> 00:07:54,943
and accompany me
peacefully to the Farragut.

146
00:07:54,967 --> 00:07:56,996
The Azrael will then
follow us out of the system.

147
00:07:57,104 --> 00:07:58,058
Go away!

148
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:01,730
I have important research
and I cannot be disturbed!

149
00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:03,876
Let me try, sir.

150
00:08:04,622 --> 00:08:08,796
Captain Glenn, it’s me, Henry Prescott.

151
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:12,775
Starfleet Academy training
mission to Altair Six?

152
00:08:14,239 --> 00:08:16,366
You were my commanding
officer on that mission...

153
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:20,628
My only mission is
to solve this mystery!

154
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,929
And I don’t care who you are!

155
00:08:24,361 --> 00:08:27,144
Mr. Prescott, Captain
Glenn is under arrest.

156
00:08:27,294 --> 00:08:28,801
Take him into custody, please.

157
00:08:31,014 --> 00:08:32,173
Aye, sir.

158
00:08:33,433 --> 00:08:35,971
Captain Glenn, please come with me.

159
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,827
I... am not going anywhere.

160
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:55,425
Sorry, Mr. Prescott. I know it
must have been difficult to see

161
00:08:55,449 --> 00:08:57,819
your former commanding officer
behaving behaving like that.

162
00:08:57,948 --> 00:09:00,275
Yes, sir, it was.

163
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:03,593
Let’s get him back to the Farragut
and see if we can sort this out.

164
00:09:14,373 --> 00:09:15,893
