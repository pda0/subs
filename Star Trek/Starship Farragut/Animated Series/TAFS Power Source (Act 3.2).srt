1
00:00:01,626 --> 00:00:03,214
Captain’s log, supplemental.

2
00:00:03,364 --> 00:00:04,957
After surviving the massive

3
00:00:05,023 --> 00:00:06,976
planetary explosion of Quorus Five,

4
00:00:07,001 --> 00:00:09,789
Captain Glenn is making
preparations to depart.

5
00:00:09,981 --> 00:00:12,028
His mission is to resume exploration

6
00:00:12,052 --> 00:00:13,782
of the remnants of that system.

7
00:00:14,049 --> 00:00:16,219
Starfleet hopes that
they will uncover answers

8
00:00:16,286 --> 00:00:18,497
to some very disconcerting questions.

9
00:00:18,689 --> 00:00:21,623
Thanks once again for pulling
us out of the jam back there.

10
00:00:22,269 --> 00:00:23,709
I feel pretty foolish.

11
00:00:23,733 --> 00:00:25,394
I almost led us all to our destruction

12
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,113
over a petty obsession.

13
00:00:27,276 --> 00:00:29,188
Doctor Holley is sure
that you and your crew

14
00:00:29,254 --> 00:00:31,247
were not responsible for your actions.

15
00:00:31,802 --> 00:00:33,435
And yet she couldn’t produce evidence

16
00:00:33,459 --> 00:00:35,790
of any medical reason for our condition.

17
00:00:35,982 --> 00:00:37,609
We all suffered something from being

18
00:00:37,633 --> 00:00:39,686
exposed to that alien technology.

19
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:43,242
You, Mr. Prescott? I
don’t recall noticing

20
00:00:43,266 --> 00:00:44,589
you having any difficulties.

21
00:00:44,823 --> 00:00:46,532
My particular training should have

22
00:00:46,556 --> 00:00:48,336
allowed me to keep it under control.

23
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:50,771
However, my performance in the lab

24
00:00:50,795 --> 00:00:52,756
would seem to indicate otherwise.

25
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:55,903
Well, in the end you
came through for us.

26
00:00:56,163 --> 00:00:59,943
Yes. Captain Glenn, I’m... sorry

27
00:00:59,968 --> 00:01:02,199
for what happened on the Azrael bridge.

28
00:01:02,223 --> 00:01:03,909
I hope you don’t think less of me.

29
00:01:04,101 --> 00:01:07,822
On the contrary. You’ve
once again demonstrated

30
00:01:07,888 --> 00:01:10,442
excellence in the
performance of your duty.

31
00:01:10,936 --> 00:01:13,344
Anyway, the whole thing seems

32
00:01:13,368 --> 00:01:16,083
somehow unreal now.

33
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:17,318
Thank you, sir.

34
00:01:17,553 --> 00:01:20,226
I’m just sorry your
Smithfield couldn’t be here.

35
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,955
I was rather looking
forward to meeting her.

36
00:01:23,021 --> 00:01:25,922
No, sir, you might
not enjoy that meeting.

37
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:28,487
She’s still in her engine
room trying to repair

38
00:01:28,511 --> 00:01:30,732
the mess that she thinks you caused.

39
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,677
The last time I saw
her she was grumbling

40
00:01:32,743 --> 00:01:34,987
something that included
your name and some

41
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:37,484
choice words that I had to look up.

42
00:01:53,217 --> 00:01:54,426
Come.

43
00:01:59,236 --> 00:02:00,514
Don’t tell me you forgot about

44
00:02:00,538 --> 00:02:02,186
our Friday night poker game.

45
00:02:02,716 --> 00:02:05,059
Well, to tell you the truth...

46
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,276
He did.

47
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,088
I know that look.

48
00:02:09,154 --> 00:02:10,808
You’ve got something on your mind.

49
00:02:10,832 --> 00:02:12,242
Don’t we all?

50
00:02:12,602 --> 00:02:14,459
We were witness to an amazing display

51
00:02:14,483 --> 00:02:17,455
of power and an
incredible feat of genius.

52
00:02:17,689 --> 00:02:19,424
I can’t help but wonder if there are

53
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:22,489
more remnants of that
unusual alien technology.

54
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,323
My money says there is,

55
00:02:24,347 --> 00:02:25,704
but what I’m more curious about

56
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:27,778
is what that technology was used for.

57
00:02:28,012 --> 00:02:30,411
When you were insisting
that we activate the device

58
00:02:30,435 --> 00:02:31,532
you seemed pretty close

59
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:33,168
to some sort of revelation.

60
00:02:33,192 --> 00:02:34,843
It’s like a dream now.

61
00:02:34,951 --> 00:02:36,733
You know how the most ridiculous things

62
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,560
can seem logical when
you’re having a dream,

63
00:02:38,584 --> 00:02:40,541
but when you wake up you
can’t make sense of it

64
00:02:40,607 --> 00:02:42,702
no matter how hard you try?

65
00:02:42,768 --> 00:02:45,309
The way my engineering
systems kept acting up...

66
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:48,615
that certainly feels more
like a dream now than reality.

67
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:51,108
At least I wish it was a dream.

68
00:02:51,384 --> 00:02:53,249
Well, Prescott thinks it was meant

69
00:02:53,315 --> 00:02:55,320
to be some sort of doomsday weapon.

70
00:02:55,344 --> 00:02:57,779
I’d rather think that it
had a more positive use.

71
00:02:57,971 --> 00:03:00,579
Quorus Four is a good
orbital distance from the sun

72
00:03:00,603 --> 00:03:02,605
and with a little help
could be terraformed

73
00:03:02,671 --> 00:03:04,583
into a nice little habitable planet.

74
00:03:04,733 --> 00:03:07,005
All it would need is a
good secondary energy source

75
00:03:07,029 --> 00:03:09,410
to maintain an ideal
Class M environment.

76
00:03:09,434 --> 00:03:13,149
A logical possibility
if a bit unromantic.

77
00:03:13,173 --> 00:03:15,007
I can imagine that power being used

78
00:03:15,031 --> 00:03:18,327
to fuel perhaps a massive
teleportation device...

79
00:03:18,393 --> 00:03:20,770
one that could send entire civilizations

80
00:03:20,794 --> 00:03:23,241
to the other side of the known universe.

81
00:03:23,475 --> 00:03:27,779
Talk about the ultimate
mission of first contact...
