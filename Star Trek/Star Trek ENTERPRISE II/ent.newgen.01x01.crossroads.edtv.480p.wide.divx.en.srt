1
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:31,820
The Enterprise has been back from the
Expanse for two months.

2
00:00:32,663 --> 00:00:35,250
We saved the Earth from the Xindi’s planet killing weapon

3
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,605
but the effects of the earlier attack continued to be felt by all.

4
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:42,645
Especially those, that lost family or friends.

5
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,954
The Enterprise has been in space-dock for a complete refit.

6
00:00:44,979 --> 00:00:47,270
Most of the crew returned from
much-needed shore-leave,

7
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,500
to help test a special addition to the ship.

8
00:01:03,545 --> 00:01:07,110
This view still impresses me today,
as much as it did the very first time.

9
00:01:07,436 --> 00:01:10,149
Yeah, I can’t disagree with that

10
00:01:12,592 --> 00:01:14,457
I wish my father had lived to see this.

11
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,572
Well, I’m sure he’s watching.

12
00:01:16,763 --> 00:01:17,763
Thank-you Trip.

13
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:37,057
When Zefram Cochrane experienced
the first warp flight,

14
00:01:37,196 --> 00:01:39,686
it must have been an incredible feeling.

15
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,340
Because of his engine, mankind
is able to explore space.

16
00:01:46,408 --> 00:01:48,356
Today, we unveil an update,

17
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,420
an engine that will change
space travel, forever!

18
00:01:52,968 --> 00:01:56,340
The trans-mix warp-drive will enable
us to break the warp five barrier.

19
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,270
And it is the honor of the Enterprise,
to be the first ship to test this new engine.

20
00:02:04,199 --> 00:02:09,851
This is our chance to experience some
of the magic, that Cochrane felt.

21
00:02:11,014 --> 00:02:15,219
A toast: May this technology let us boldly go,

22
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:18,219
where no man has gone before.

23
00:03:31,642 --> 00:03:34,864
Captain’s star log:
April 10th, 2154

24
00:03:36,255 --> 00:03:40,035
We are underway to the Kasaten-System,
to test the new trans-mix drive.

25
00:03:41,128 --> 00:03:45,089
This historic event is marred only
by the absences of Ensign Sato,

26
00:03:45,114 --> 00:03:47,582
who is attending a lingual
research conference on Vulcan,

27
00:03:47,817 --> 00:03:52,302
and Doctor Phlox, who extended his shore-leave
to reunite with his son on Denebola.

28
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:53,941
He hasn’t seen him in 10 years.

29
00:03:54,941 --> 00:03:57,214
Although it is sad, that they will not be with us,

30
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:59,290
the rest of the crew is looking forward to the test.

31
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:01,306
[Door chime] Computer pause. Enter!

32
00:04:02,587 --> 00:04:03,357
Trip?

33
00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:04,125
Captain.

34
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:06,756
What can I do for you?
Is everything okay?

35
00:04:06,986 --> 00:04:09,545
Yeah... No!

36
00:04:09,863 --> 00:04:10,732
What’s wrong?

37
00:04:10,779 --> 00:04:13,921
When the ship was being refitted,
and I’d returned from Vulcan,

38
00:04:14,075 --> 00:04:17,286
I went back to Florida.
At least what’s left of it.

39
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,709
I lost nearly my entire family, Captain.

40
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:21,830
I just can’t believe they’re gone.

41
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:27,438
I understand, Trip. It’s never easy when people
we love, are suddenly snatched away.

42
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,436
My father’s death still weighs on my mind,
especially on days like this.

43
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:39,409
But we are out here, achieving and exceeding their dreams.
I think that’s something our families will be proud of.

44
00:04:39,707 --> 00:04:42,707
Dammit Captain, I wasn’t
there when they needed me!

45
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:46,360
I know, but you can still honor their memory, Trip.

46
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:50,029
Today marks a huge step forward for Starfleet.

47
00:04:50,069 --> 00:04:53,957
You know she isn’t here to say it;
I know your sister would be proud of you.

48
00:04:54,069 --> 00:04:57,010
Yeah, I guess you’re right.

49
00:04:57,169 --> 00:04:59,102
[Intercom] Bridge to Captain.

50
00:05:00,692 --> 00:05:02,797
Go ahead, Travis.

51
00:05:02,924 --> 00:05:05,820
Sir, we’ve reached the Kasaten system.

52
00:05:05,933 --> 00:05:07,709
Alright, Travis, bring us out of warp.

53
00:05:08,534 --> 00:05:10,484
Mr. Tucker, are you ready to make history?

54
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,779
Aye, Captain - with pleasure.

55
00:05:20,306 --> 00:05:21,306
Status?

56
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:24,156
Sir, we’re in position reading full stop.

57
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:28,110
Plot a course for the nebula, Ensign.
Trip, is the new system online?

58
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:31,260
Aye Captain. Engage the engine, Mr. Mayweather.

59
00:05:32,101 --> 00:05:33,260
Aye, sir.

60
00:05:39,817 --> 00:05:40,817
Warp one.

61
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,735
Warp two.

62
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,760
Warp three.

63
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:48,350
Warp four.

64
00:05:49,209 --> 00:05:50,368
Warp five

65
00:05:51,527 --> 00:05:52,927
Warp five point five.

66
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:57,030
This is faster than any human has ever traveled!

67
00:06:05,513 --> 00:06:07,863
Trip how’s it going?
Can we push it any further?

68
00:06:08,073 --> 00:06:10,754
It’s all looking good, ready for warp six, sir.

69
00:06:11,906 --> 00:06:14,488
Travis, you heard the man, increase speed.

70
00:06:14,671 --> 00:06:15,671
Yes, sir!

71
00:06:23,556 --> 00:06:24,656
Report?

72
00:06:24,846 --> 00:06:27,834
Dammit, the engines are overloading.

73
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,301
Travis, take it offline.

74
00:06:30,326 --> 00:06:31,691
No response!

75
00:06:31,716 --> 00:06:35,110
Captain, the data relay is fine.
I can’t shut it down!

76
00:06:35,954 --> 00:06:39,514
Captain,  engineering reports core breech is imminent.

77
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:41,898
I’ll have to bypass a relay,
this will take a minute.

78
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:44,517
Trip, we don’t have time, hurry!

79
00:06:44,867 --> 00:06:47,957
Core breech in, ten seconds.

80
00:06:52,707 --> 00:06:53,835
Five!

81
00:06:54,603 --> 00:06:55,618
Trip!!

82
00:06:55,962 --> 00:06:57,430
Four.

83
00:06:59,255 --> 00:07:00,278
Three.

84
00:07:02,025 --> 00:07:02,815
I got it!

85
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,358
NOW, Travis.

86
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,589
Damage report?

87
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:22,257
Warp engines are offline, we’re down to impulse only.
There is severe damage to the hull plating.

88
00:07:22,565 --> 00:07:24,822
Trip, would you mind telling me,
what the hell happened?

89
00:07:25,006 --> 00:07:29,787
Sir, I can’t explain it. The new engines
shoulda reached warp 6.5, easily.

90
00:07:29,865 --> 00:07:33,635
I want a damage analysis.
Travis, where are we?

91
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,660
We’ve reached the Kasaten nebula,
but something’s wrong!

92
00:07:37,329 --> 00:07:40,640
Sensors indicate, that the nebula is a
completely different shape and size

93
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,360
than what’s recorded in our star charts!

94
00:07:42,818 --> 00:07:43,951
What do you mean?

95
00:07:44,055 --> 00:07:47,472
Either it’s a sensor glitch, or
we’re in a different part of space.

96
00:07:47,702 --> 00:07:49,344
Mr. Mayweather is correct,

97
00:07:50,294 --> 00:07:52,829
we’re no longer in the Kasaten system.

98
00:07:52,854 --> 00:07:54,181
Then where are we?

99
00:07:54,793 --> 00:07:56,023
Unknown...

100
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:01,930
It is possible that the imbalance of the engine,
created a subspace vortex,

101
00:08:02,192 --> 00:08:05,720
which sent us to another destination,
but left the navigation computer

102
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,991
believing that we are at the intended coordinates.

103
00:08:08,038 --> 00:08:08,915
Are you sure?

104
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,687
It is only a hypothesis.

105
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:15,747
Captain, long-range senses just
picked up a ship. Seems to be adrift.

106
00:08:15,804 --> 00:08:17,001
What kind of ship?

107
00:08:17,065 --> 00:08:18,532
Unknown configuration.

108
00:08:19,523 --> 00:08:20,490
T’Pol?

109
00:08:20,515 --> 00:08:23,170
It matches no ship in the
Vulcan database, Captain.

110
00:08:23,692 --> 00:08:24,997
Open a channel.

111
00:08:25,632 --> 00:08:29,870
This is Captain Johnathan Archer
of the USS Enterprise, can you hear me?

112
00:08:30,053 --> 00:08:31,515
No response.

113
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:33,261
Scan for bio-signs.

114
00:08:33,462 --> 00:08:34,810
Negative, Captain.

115
00:08:34,961 --> 00:08:37,204
Ensign, set a course for the ship.

116
00:08:37,493 --> 00:08:39,056
I want to take a closer look.

117
00:08:39,177 --> 00:08:40,294
Aye, sir.

118
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:53,610
Fascinating!

119
00:08:53,714 --> 00:08:54,811
What is it, Commander?

120
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:57,427
The planet we are passing is Minshara class.

121
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:58,541
What about it?

122
00:08:58,699 --> 00:09:00,850
I am not reading any life-signs.

123
00:09:01,857 --> 00:09:04,466
Not even bacteria or microbes.

124
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:07,355
An ecological disaster?

125
00:09:07,586 --> 00:09:08,586
No!

126
00:09:09,568 --> 00:09:12,586
Such an event would have left obvious signs.

127
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,546
Captain, we’re approaching the ship.

128
00:09:27,643 --> 00:09:30,553
Looks like it took, one hell of a beating.

129
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:34,550
Ship is designated: "Enterprise"

130
00:09:35,028 --> 00:09:38,377
Check long-range sensors.
Are there any more ships in the system?

131
00:09:38,457 --> 00:09:40,620
Negative, we’re the only ones, here.

132
00:09:41,343 --> 00:09:42,890
Is the transporter online?

133
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,791
I want to go over there and take a look around.

134
00:09:44,822 --> 00:09:47,995
Yes, it received only minor damage.

135
00:09:48,643 --> 00:09:51,949
Let’s suit up then.
Malcolm, you have the Conn.

136
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,357
Sir, I don’t think it’s wise for you to go without a
security team. We don’t know what’s over there.

137
00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:00,250
I need you on Enterprise, Lieutenant,
in case we get unexpected company.

138
00:10:00,313 --> 00:10:02,516
Aye, Captain.

139
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:19,310
[T’Pol] From these readings, I estimate the ship
has been here for approximately five years.

140
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:23,420
The internal damage,
isn’t as bad as I expected.

141
00:10:23,491 --> 00:10:29,531
Yes, it would seem they were under
attack for a short period, only

142
00:10:29,617 --> 00:10:31,697
before effecting a retreat.

143
00:10:34,463 --> 00:10:35,486
Captain?

144
00:10:36,601 --> 00:10:38,042
What is it?

145
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,399
According to the bio-scanner, it’s a human.

146
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,246
What? How did a human get this far out?

147
00:10:47,962 --> 00:10:49,872
Unknown.

148
00:10:49,985 --> 00:10:54,075
Scans indicate this vessel
is made of unknown alloys.

149
00:10:54,414 --> 00:10:58,932
I wonder what they were doing here.
Why were you attacked?

150
00:11:04,807 --> 00:11:10,973
Captain, there is another here.
This one’s Vulcan.

151
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:22,330
[Red alert klaxon]

152
00:11:22,425 --> 00:11:23,425
[screams]

153
00:11:23,709 --> 00:11:24,987
[Kirk] Sulu, get us out of here.

154
00:11:25,012 --> 00:11:26,289
[Sulu] We’re losing power, Captain.

155
00:11:26,345 --> 00:11:27,888
[Kirk] Mr. Scott, what’s going on?

156
00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:31,181
[Scotty] We’re a sitting duck, Captain.
There’s nothing we can do.

157
00:11:31,206 --> 00:11:34,386
These metal creatures are
tearing our engines apart.

158
00:11:40,044 --> 00:11:42,407
T’Pol, are you okay?

159
00:11:42,988 --> 00:11:45,152
I know what happened, here.

160
00:11:46,816 --> 00:11:50,366
They were attacked, by a species

161
00:11:51,763 --> 00:11:53,898
called the "Red Empire."

162
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:10,107
What the hell is this Red Empire?
What happened to you back on the ship?

163
00:12:10,384 --> 00:12:12,470
When I touched, the dead Vulcan,

164
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:18,185
I had some kind of vision,
almost like mind-meld.

165
00:12:20,013 --> 00:12:21,710
I saw what happened to them.

166
00:12:22,446 --> 00:12:23,446
And?

167
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:30,079
[Spock] T’Pol, hear us...

168
00:12:31,048 --> 00:12:32,375
Are you alright, Commander?

169
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:36,060
Yes..., yes I’m fine.

170
00:12:36,277 --> 00:12:38,121
I think you should go to sick bay.

171
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:44,145
No, I’ll return to my quarters
and rest, and meditate.

172
00:12:44,963 --> 00:12:47,200
[Interkom beep] Tucker to Archer.

173
00:12:49,438 --> 00:12:50,472
Yes, Commander.

174
00:12:50,758 --> 00:12:54,348
Could you come down to engineering, Captain.
I’ve got something to show you.

175
00:12:54,714 --> 00:12:55,729
On my way.

176
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:12,870
What have you got for me?

177
00:13:14,269 --> 00:13:16,399
It’s the warp coils, sir.

178
00:13:16,493 --> 00:13:17,675
What’s wrong with them?

179
00:13:17,794 --> 00:13:19,366
It was no accident, they overloaded.

180
00:13:19,374 --> 00:13:21,307
You mean they were sabotaged?

181
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,275
At a guess, I’d say so Captain.

182
00:13:23,436 --> 00:13:24,690
What’s the evidence?

183
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:29,518
The warp field was calibrated to collapse at warp 6.
The coil burned out and the engine overloaded.

184
00:13:29,613 --> 00:13:34,421
Now, none of my crew have been near the thing,
since the core of engineers installed it, back in Starfleet.

185
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:36,440
Are you certain, Trip?

186
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:41,785
Captain, I checked the data. Someone
aboard this ship wanted this test to fail.

187
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:45,090
I just don’t understand.
Why would anyone do this?

188
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:46,285
Perhaps it was the Suliban?

189
00:13:46,334 --> 00:13:48,992
No, the temporal cold war is over.

190
00:13:49,143 --> 00:13:52,540
They’ve nothing to gain.
This was someone else.

191
00:13:52,723 --> 00:13:53,723
Well who?

192
00:13:53,961 --> 00:13:56,700
I don’t know Trip, but I intend to find out.

193
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:02,122
[Spock] T’Pol, come to us.

194
00:14:02,186 --> 00:14:03,336
Who are you?

195
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:07,917
[Kirk] We are the echo of lost souls.
You are in great danger...

196
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:38,994
Where are you?

197
00:14:39,782 --> 00:14:43,462
[Spock] We’re inside your mind, it is
necessary that we speak with you.

198
00:14:45,207 --> 00:14:47,812
Do not play games.

199
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,396
Show yourselves.

200
00:15:19,064 --> 00:15:20,779
[T’Pol] What have you done to our ship?

201
00:15:20,858 --> 00:15:22,265
[Spock] We are not responsible.

202
00:15:22,312 --> 00:15:25,265
[Kirk] Your Enterprise is inside the time-mirror.

203
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:29,123
An inter-dimensional rift where
many parallel universes, intersect.

204
00:15:29,148 --> 00:15:31,885
Then you are from one of
these parallel universes?

205
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:35,403
Yes, one very much like your own.
But ours took a different path.

206
00:15:35,428 --> 00:15:40,204
[Scotty] Captain, we don’t have much time.
Tell her about the "Red Empire."

207
00:15:40,217 --> 00:15:43,368
I’ve heard that name before.
Who are they?

208
00:15:43,369 --> 00:15:46,514
They’re machines from a different
universe with only one goal:

209
00:15:46,515 --> 00:15:49,587
The destruction of all biological lifeforms.

210
00:15:49,588 --> 00:15:53,752
They were created by a cruel and arrogant
version of our own Terran Empire,

211
00:15:53,753 --> 00:15:58,767
to serve humanity. But their control over them
was lost and they escaped into the Time-Mirror.

212
00:15:58,768 --> 00:16:03,459
When your ship tested it’s new drive, it opened
the rift for them into your universe, lassie!

213
00:16:03,819 --> 00:16:06,616
Now the robots are massing
an invasion force!

214
00:16:06,617 --> 00:16:10,084
But first they need information on
the civilizations of your universe.

215
00:16:10,085 --> 00:16:13,045
Planetary  co-ordinates,
bio-data, technology.

216
00:16:13,046 --> 00:16:16,065
All your strengths and
weaknesses ready to exploit.

217
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,361
What can we do?

218
00:16:17,424 --> 00:16:20,666
Return to your universe
and seal the tear in the rift.

219
00:16:21,301 --> 00:16:22,301
It’s the only way.

220
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:23,772
We can’t get back!

221
00:16:24,364 --> 00:16:29,435
Even if we knew how to recreate the exact
conditions of the accident that brought us here,

222
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:32,961
the warp-drive is still non-operational.

223
00:16:32,962 --> 00:16:37,209
You’re being here is no accident.
This was carefully planned.

224
00:16:37,392 --> 00:16:39,744
Someone is hiding
aboard your ship.

225
00:16:39,887 --> 00:16:42,879
Tell me how to get the
engine back online.

226
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:47,110
A Red Empire vessel that uses the same
type of warp-coil as your new drive!

227
00:16:47,111 --> 00:16:49,080
They will attack your ship as it did ours.

228
00:16:49,081 --> 00:16:53,960
If you can deactivate their shields, you can
steal theirs right from under their metal noses!

229
00:16:53,961 --> 00:16:57,395
Mr. Spock will give you the data we
collected on their ship during our battle.

230
00:16:57,396 --> 00:16:58,802
Very well.

231
00:16:58,827 --> 00:17:00,280
Time is of the essence.

232
00:17:00,281 --> 00:17:04,406
You must return now.
Long life and prosperity, T’Pol.

233
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:11,598
[door chime]

234
00:17:17,989 --> 00:17:20,787
[door opening]

235
00:17:25,204 --> 00:17:27,032
T’Pol!

236
00:17:27,033 --> 00:17:30,323
Commander?

237
00:17:31,591 --> 00:17:32,703
Hello?

238
00:17:47,793 --> 00:17:48,793
[Kiss]

239
00:17:49,793 --> 00:17:52,428
Hello to you, too!
Now where the hell have you been?

240
00:17:52,429 --> 00:17:55,548
I was contacted by
the derelict’s dead crew.

241
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:56,347
What?

242
00:17:56,372 --> 00:17:58,307
They told me our
ship was sabotaged.

243
00:17:58,332 --> 00:18:01,270
Yeah, we know. Someone
tampered with the warp-field!

244
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:02,958
What else did you find out?

245
00:18:02,983 --> 00:18:08,467
Commander, we’ve been thrown into a rift,
where parallel universes converge.

246
00:18:08,468 --> 00:18:10,256
Are you feelin’ all right?

247
00:18:10,492 --> 00:18:13,580
A race of machines from one of those
worlds has been trapped here

248
00:18:13,581 --> 00:18:15,675
and now they plan
to invade ours!

249
00:18:15,676 --> 00:18:17,566
They used Enterprise to open the door

250
00:18:17,567 --> 00:18:23,057
and now they want the information from
the ship’s data-core to prepare their invasion.

251
00:18:23,058 --> 00:18:25,026
An invasion. Of Earth?!

252
00:18:25,051 --> 00:18:27,223
Not just the Earth.

253
00:18:27,224 --> 00:18:28,979
Our entire galaxy.

254
00:18:29,004 --> 00:18:30,517
We gotta warn the Capt’n!

255
00:18:30,518 --> 00:18:33,993
The "red" agent who sabotaged
the engine, is still on board.

256
00:18:34,818 --> 00:18:39,170
They can manipulate the human mind.
It could be in anyone.

257
00:18:39,171 --> 00:18:41,269
You don’t suspect
Captain Archer, do you?

258
00:18:41,294 --> 00:18:42,294
Commander.

259
00:18:43,109 --> 00:18:45,850
The stakes are too high to take any risks!

260
00:18:45,851 --> 00:18:49,198
I have to be sure he’s the
real Archer, first!

261
00:18:49,199 --> 00:18:50,991
So why did you trust me?!

262
00:18:51,016 --> 00:18:52,207
The kiss.

263
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:57,330
We have a telepathic bond, remember?
I would have known immediately.

264
00:18:58,576 --> 00:19:00,484
OK, so what do we do?

265
00:19:00,509 --> 00:19:02,022
I know how to
repair our engines,

266
00:19:02,023 --> 00:19:06,574
but first we have to get to the bridge
and stop them from stealing our data.

267
00:19:06,575 --> 00:19:08,680
I hope you’re right about all this!

268
00:19:21,014 --> 00:19:23,327
Sir, a ship is approaching!

269
00:19:23,352 --> 00:19:24,447
Configuration?

270
00:19:24,701 --> 00:19:25,788
Unknown.

271
00:19:27,442 --> 00:19:29,672
Reed, full tactical analysis!

272
00:19:29,697 --> 00:19:31,938
12 torpedo-batteries;
8 phaser banks!

273
00:19:31,973 --> 00:19:33,919
Their hull-plating is made of
an unknown alloy.

274
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:37,152
And their primary and secondary shields
are set to a rotating frequency.

275
00:19:37,827 --> 00:19:40,673
I’ve never seen a vessel that heavily armed, sir!

276
00:19:41,076 --> 00:19:44,579
Captain, I have to talk to you.

277
00:19:48,429 --> 00:19:50,834
He is Jonathan Archer!

278
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,945
T’Pol, what is it?

279
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:57,923
That is the ship that
attacked the derelict.

280
00:19:57,924 --> 00:20:00,800
You mean that’s this, "Red Empire"?

281
00:20:00,801 --> 00:20:04,063
Yes. We have to protect our data-core.

282
00:20:04,792 --> 00:20:06,167
Lieutenant Reed!

283
00:20:09,549 --> 00:20:12,622
[computer voice]
Accessing communication protocol.

284
00:20:13,329 --> 00:20:15,724
[computer voice]
Access granted.

285
00:20:15,795 --> 00:20:18,604
[computer voice]
Preparing transfer of data.

286
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,974
[computer voice]
Transfer commencing.

287
00:20:25,219 --> 00:20:27,255
Captain it’s too late.
They’ve accessed the core!

288
00:20:27,256 --> 00:20:30,046
They’re copying all the data
we acquired in the past 3 years.

289
00:20:30,047 --> 00:20:31,666
T’Pol, stop that transfer!

290
00:20:31,691 --> 00:20:32,915
They’re charging weapons!

291
00:20:33,714 --> 00:20:34,978
Too late, they’re firing!

292
00:20:35,003 --> 00:20:36,109
Brace for impact!

293
00:20:41,564 --> 00:20:42,564
[Explosion]

294
00:20:43,572 --> 00:20:45,281
[Tactical alert klaxon]

295
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:47,554
Captain, I’m unable to stop the transfer.

296
00:20:48,066 --> 00:20:49,408
The port is locked.

297
00:20:49,433 --> 00:20:50,417
Damage report!

298
00:20:50,442 --> 00:20:54,665
Heavy damage on the exterior hull.
New emergency force-fields are holding.

299
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:56,850
There’s another ship approaching!

300
00:20:58,149 --> 00:20:59,931
[Titan drops out of warp]

301
00:21:03,579 --> 00:21:04,869
They are hailing us.

302
00:21:04,894 --> 00:21:05,909
On screen.

303
00:21:06,918 --> 00:21:07,956
Audio only?

304
00:21:07,981 --> 00:21:09,136
Open a channel!

305
00:21:10,398 --> 00:21:13,080
[Kirk] "Looks like you need
some help, Captain Archer."

306
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,659
How do you know my name?

307
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,683
"We also know, you’re
from another universe"

308
00:21:16,684 --> 00:21:17,884
How?

309
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:20,226
There’s no time for explanations!

310
00:21:22,096 --> 00:21:25,975
You’ve only got one chance to get
back home and protect your world!

311
00:21:26,998 --> 00:21:30,193
We’re gonna help you destroy
that ship and the data it stole!

312
00:21:30,194 --> 00:21:32,670
I don’t think this is a fight we can win!

313
00:21:32,671 --> 00:21:34,438
They’re too well armed.

314
00:21:34,463 --> 00:21:35,964
"You don’t have a
choice, Mister!"

315
00:21:35,965 --> 00:21:39,390
"Either we take out that ship,
or it’s the end of everything!"

316
00:21:40,064 --> 00:21:41,429
"For all of us!"

317
00:21:41,582 --> 00:21:42,892
"Titan out."

318
00:21:43,509 --> 00:21:44,813
What do you think, T’Pol?

319
00:21:44,814 --> 00:21:50,867
The Red Empire’s ship uses the same type
of warp-coil as our own Transmix-drive.

320
00:21:51,489 --> 00:21:55,050
If we set our phasers to a
different frequency from the Titan’s

321
00:21:55,085 --> 00:22:00,341
our combined firepower may be
able to destabilize their shields long enough

322
00:22:00,342 --> 00:22:04,160
to beam out the coil
and take their engines offline.

323
00:22:04,161 --> 00:22:05,682
Very well.

324
00:22:05,683 --> 00:22:06,770
Tactical alert!

325
00:22:17,122 --> 00:22:19,389
We’re packing quite a punch, sir.

326
00:22:19,598 --> 00:22:22,693
Our exterior hull isn’t going to
last long under this kind of assault!

327
00:22:22,737 --> 00:22:25,260

328

332
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:51,342
What about their shields?

333
00:22:51,901 --> 00:22:52,869
Unaffected.

334
00:22:52,894 --> 00:22:55,506

life-support to weapons!

336
00:23:17,216 --> 00:23:18,718

339
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,432
Seal those areas!

340
00:23:24,457 --> 00:23:25,698
I can’t, there’s
not enough power!

341
00:23:25,699 --> 00:23:29,191
We’re losing atmosphere!
Another direct hit will finish us, Captain!

342
00:23:30,052 --> 00:23:31,976
T’Pol, raise the Titan!

343
00:23:32,001 --> 00:23:32,668
"Captain?"

344
00:23:32,669 --> 00:23:34,960
Our ship’s not gonna last much longer, Titan.

345
00:23:34,961 --> 00:23:37,070
There’s no point in dying for nothing!

346
00:23:37,071 --> 00:23:40,882
I suggest we retreat while we
still can and make another plan!

347
00:23:40,883 --> 00:23:43,003
"We have to destroy them, Jonathan! "

348
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:45,416
"Yours is not the only universe at stake here."

349
00:23:45,417 --> 00:23:48,994
"If they gain themselves a foothold,
their forces will be unstoppable!"

350
00:23:48,995 --> 00:23:53,143
If we could just disrupt their shields for a
moment, we could beam out their warp coil.

351
00:23:53,144 --> 00:23:54,805
They’d be dead in the water!

352
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:56,356
"There’s only one
thing we can do:"

353
00:23:56,357 --> 00:23:59,333
"Retreat, but stay
within transporter range."

354
00:23:59,947 --> 00:24:02,000
"You’re going to
get your coil."

355
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:03,048
What are you doing?

356
00:24:03,272 --> 00:24:05,291
[T´Pol] He stopped transmitting.

357
00:24:06,272 --> 00:24:08,037
[huge explosion]

358
00:24:11,498 --> 00:24:14,072
Reverse course!
Get us out of here!

359
00:24:14,097 --> 00:24:16,155
Sir, I think I know
what he’s planning.

360
00:24:16,727 --> 00:24:18,024
On screen!

361
00:24:26,239 --> 00:24:27,826
The Titan’s shields are down!

362
00:24:27,851 --> 00:24:29,333
Beam that coil out!

363
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,976
[Transporter operating]
Got it, Capt’n!

364
00:24:34,977 --> 00:24:36,886
Full impulse, Ensign!

365
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:43,279
[explosion]

366
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,125
Captain we have a level-3 shock-wave,
heading straight for us!

367
00:24:47,126 --> 00:24:48,695
Can we outrun it?

368
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,753
No chance! It’s too fast!

369
00:24:50,754 --> 00:24:52,002
Brace for impact!

370
00:25:43,975 --> 00:25:47,133
[computer voice]
Accessing communication protocol.

371
00:25:47,309 --> 00:25:49,488

00:25:53,943 --> 00:25:56,584

[groans]

376
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,626
Report!

377
00:26:22,752 --> 00:26:25,392
Heavy damage to the exterior hull.

378
00:26:25,393 --> 00:26:27,530
Engines and weapons are offline.

379
00:26:28,263 --> 00:26:31,323
Any other ships in this sector?!

380
00:26:31,348 --> 00:26:32,660
Mr. Mayweather?

381
00:26:32,685 --> 00:26:34,043
Ah, no...

382
00:26:34,425 --> 00:26:37,091
No other vessels.
We’re alone!

383
00:26:37,092 --> 00:26:40,097
Trip, how long before
we can have our engines back?

384
00:26:40,616 --> 00:26:41,802
Hard to tell Capt’n!

385
00:26:41,803 --> 00:26:44,183
48 hours repairs;
then there’s a new coil:

386
00:26:44,184 --> 00:26:46,405
We’re talking three,
maybe four days?!

387
00:26:46,406 --> 00:26:49,563
Let’s hope our enemies don’t return!

388
00:26:50,402 --> 00:26:53,202
Captain’s log; supplemental:

389
00:26:53,203 --> 00:26:55,790
We successfully managed to
install the warp coil we captured

390
00:26:55,791 --> 00:26:59,814
from the red Empire’s ship. Cmdr Tucker
is hopeful it will get us home.

391
00:27:00,836 --> 00:27:03,318
I’m still puzzled over the
identity of the Titan-crew

392
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:05,352
and how they knew so much about us.

393
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,504
Perhaps we’ll never know.

394
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:11,502
But their sacrifice saved our lives
and will not be forgotten.

395
00:27:12,673 --> 00:27:16,823
Another thing that troubles me
is the alien saboteur aboard our ship.

396
00:27:16,824 --> 00:27:21,438
And despite extensive searching,
we have not yet been able to locate!

397
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:23,727
[door chime]
Computer: Pause!

398
00:27:23,728 --> 00:27:24,995
Enter!
[doors opening]

399
00:27:24,996 --> 00:27:27,052
Capt’n the Transmix-drive
is back online

400
00:27:27,053 --> 00:27:29,393
but it’s gonna take several
weeks to repair that other nacelle.

401
00:27:29,394 --> 00:27:32,705
Good work, Trip!
I’m afraid we can’t wait that long.

402
00:27:33,218 --> 00:27:35,648
I want you to put this place
behind us, as soon as possible!

403
00:27:35,861 --> 00:27:38,576
Prepare to go to
warp 1, in one hour!

404
00:27:38,601 --> 00:27:39,813
Aye, aye, sir!

405
00:27:52,589 --> 00:27:55,475
We’ve experienced a lot in the
last three years...

406
00:27:55,476 --> 00:27:58,016
We lost allies, friends and family.

407
00:27:58,017 --> 00:28:02,117
We made it home every time.
And we’ll make it back this time, too!

408
00:28:03,967 --> 00:28:06,712
I’m proud to be the captain
of such a valiant crew!

409
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,661
I know that it’s risky to use the
Transmix-drive with only one nacelle,

410
00:28:11,098 --> 00:28:13,712
but we still have to try!

411
00:28:14,472 --> 00:28:17,818
Mr. Mayweather, take us home!

412

[Trailer for part 2, after the credits.]

414
00:30:28,134 --> 00:30:32,867
These ships have been destroyed,
not more than two days ago, Captain.

415
00:30:38,408 --> 00:30:41,208
Sir, I can’t establish contact with Earth!

416
00:30:53,996 --> 00:30:59,329
Sir, the enemy’s warp signature,
it’s identical with the ships in the Time-Mirror.

417
00:31:03,526 --> 00:31:05,310
Captain, one of them is approaching us.

418
00:31:05,347 --> 00:31:09,580
Captain, the Vulcan, Andorian and
Starfleet vessels are being destroyed.

419
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:12,688
Even the Klingon’s are
fighting the invading forces.

420
00:31:12,736 --> 00:31:14,363
Sir, it’s not looking good!

421
00:31:14,419 --> 00:31:17,058
The allied ships are sitting ducks,
for the Empire’s attack.

422
00:31:17,082 --> 00:31:20,076
We have to do something,
we have to help them.

423
00:31:32,788 --> 00:31:36,232
Logical course of events?
We had sex, T’Pol.

424
00:31:36,518 --> 00:31:39,304
I wasn’t even expecting a Vulcan,
to do such a thing.

425
00:31:44,047 --> 00:31:46,237
I am Admiral James T. Kirk.

427
00:32:02,843 --> 00:32:06,549
The weapon is ready, awaiting your orders.

428
00:32:06,627 --> 00:32:10,453
Activate the Thalaron-Matrix.
Destroy the bio-units!
