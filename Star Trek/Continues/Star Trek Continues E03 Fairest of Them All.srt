00:00:06,851 --> 00:00:09,666
You must return to your universe.
I must have my Captain back.

00:00:09,786 --> 00:00:13,118
I shall operate the Transporter.
You have two minutes and ten seconds.

3
00:00:13,238 --> 00:00:14,831
For that time I have something to say...

4
00:00:15,072 --> 00:00:18,152
How long before the Halkan prediction
of Galactic revolt is realized?

5
00:00:18,364 --> 00:00:20,098
Approximately 240 years.

6
00:00:20,218 --> 00:00:21,363
The inevitable outcome?

7
00:00:21,483 --> 00:00:23,236
The Empire shall be
overthrown, of course.

8
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:26,462
The illogic of waste, Mr. Spock.

9
00:00:27,756 --> 00:00:30,744
A waste of lives, potential,
resources, time.

10
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:33,660
I submit to you that
your Empire is illogical...

11
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,329
Because it cannot endure.

12
00:00:36,421 --> 00:00:38,709
I submit...
That you...

13
00:00:39,018 --> 00:00:40,166
...are illogical...

14
00:00:40,437 --> 00:00:41,707

If change is inevitable,
predictable, beneficial...

17
00:00:47,387 --> 00:00:50,370
Doesn't logic demand that
you be a part of it?

18
00:00:50,582 --> 00:00:52,200
One man cannot summon the future.

19
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,938
But one man can change the present.
Be the Captain of this Enterprise, Mr. Spock.

20
00:00:56,058 --> 00:00:59,314

the Halkans and make it stick.

than any man in the fleet.

00:02:29,537 --> 00:02:32,528
It appears you were
temporarily interchanged...

...with counterparts from
a parallel universe.

40
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:38,011
Most of the crew is unaware
of these events.

41
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:43,245
I know what happened, Spock.
I wanna know why.

42
00:02:43,365 --> 00:02:47,150
The ion storm created a
transporter irregularity...

43
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:51,152
Resulting in a transposition of the
landing party's quantum wave signature.

44
00:02:51,272 --> 00:02:55,424
Chief Kyle was at the controls.
He has been disciplined.

He'd better have been.

- Sir?

47
00:02:59,854 --> 00:03:02,952
Check the transporter relays.
Make sure this doesn't happen again.

I trust the Halkans have
been dealt with?

Is the Halkan capital city in firing range?

Return to your station immediately.

00:03:56,582 --> 00:04:01,137
It is merciful of you to forgive Mr. Chekov
after his assassination attempt.

61
00:04:02,564 --> 00:04:05,236
I agree the agony booth made
a sufficient impression.

Do you have them?

Oh, no.
It's not.

You have 30 seconds to relinquish
your dilithium crystals.

68

Or this face is the
last one you'll see.

69
00:04:31,174 --> 00:04:33,717
That would be most unwise, Captain.

70
00:04:33,837 --> 00:04:38,237
But we are prepared to die to
protect what we hold dear.

A torpedo barrage is unnecessary.

78

annihilate the entire population.

...could prove profitable for the
Empire for many years to come.

You could be the first to set
the precedent of diplomacy...

...that could yield long-term benefits.
I would recommend lesser measures.

Since when do you question

The dilithium was rigged to explode.

Why didn't you detect that?

137
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:08,634

this course of action.

138
00:09:08,754 --> 00:09:10,214
The logical decision was...

139
00:09:10,334 --> 00:09:12,398
You're not paid to lecture me
in logic, Mr. Spock!

You're paid to do your job!

vengeance for the Halkans.

360

- Sir?
- Captain, it's not her fault!

399
00:25:31,489 --> 00:25:33,261
I said report to the brig!

400
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,314
That's enough!

00:26:19,563 --> 00:26:21,876
You heard the Captain.
Get to work.

411
00:26:30,914 --> 00:26:32,733
I was hoping you'd come
back during my shift.

00:26:32,853 --> 00:26:35,461
Oh.

Always.

414
00:26:52,667 --> 00:26:56,058
The device of which the other
Captain spoke, I presume.

415
00:26:56,479 --> 00:26:59,764
I am surprised Captain Kirk
did not use it on me.

416
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:02,493
Oh.
He tried.

417
00:27:15,174 --> 00:27:16,534
Fascinating.

418

419
00:27:19,876 --> 00:27:22,520
...at the Starfleet penal colony
on Tantalus Five.

420
00:27:22,746 --> 00:27:26,117
He pillaged her laboratory
after he dispensed with her.

421
00:27:26,453 --> 00:27:28,560
Then he stole this device.

422
00:27:29,508 --> 00:27:32,975
One touch and your problems
are over, Mr. Spock.

423
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,976
This'll change everything.

424
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:41,707
You would see me use
this device on him?

425
00:27:45,014 --> 00:27:45,982
I would.

426
00:27:46,796 --> 00:27:48,213
But you...

427
00:27:49,075 --> 00:27:51,124
...are the Captain's woman.

428
00:27:52,398 --> 00:27:53,250
Yes.

429
00:27:55,154 --> 00:27:57,155
But not this Captain.

Please find a way.

A way to send me where he went.

435

I cannot.

a difference here.

about this like civilized men.

and I find it compelling.

you say, Spock.

00:31:14,946 --> 00:31:17,129

Of course not.

If there is any hope for
the Empire to change...

Kill me? Take command of the Enterprise?

I believe I would.

You are hereby relieved of command.

530
00:36:18,161 --> 00:36:19,319
Let go of me!

531
00:36:19,439 --> 00:36:21,202
Do you realize
what you're doing?!

532
00:36:26,708 --> 00:36:27,663
I do.

533
00:36:41,189 --> 00:36:43,158
KIRK:
You're a coward, Spock.

534
00:36:43,593 --> 00:36:46,779
You don't even have the guts
to execute us like a real leader.

535
00:36:46,899 --> 00:36:49,385
This shuttlecraft is at
your disposal.

536
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:52,918
I recommend setting a course
to the nearest habitable system.

537
00:36:53,295 --> 00:36:55,612
You have sufficient supplies
to last until then.

538
00:36:55,732 --> 00:36:57,772
You think that changes anything?

539
00:36:57,892 --> 00:37:01,914
So you've taken control of one ship.
So what? What now?

540
00:37:02,522 --> 00:37:04,144
Peace?

541
00:37:04,636 --> 00:37:06,056
Freedom?

542
00:37:06,837 --> 00:37:10,371
The Empire will hunt you down
like the mangy dog that you are.

543
00:37:12,022 --> 00:37:13,122
Perhaps...

544
00:37:13,499 --> 00:37:14,918
But I must try...

545
00:37:27,904 --> 00:37:30,018
You won't get away
with this, Spock.

546
00:37:30,138 --> 00:37:32,509
You're just one man.

547
00:37:32,629 --> 00:37:36,042
In every revolution there is
one man with a vision.

548
00:37:36,708 --> 00:37:38,446
Who told you that?

549
00:37:39,547 --> 00:37:40,792
You did.

550
00:37:41,921 --> 00:37:44,586
Spock...!!!

551
00:37:44,706 --> 00:37:47,453
[KIRK'S CRY CONTINUES TO ECHO]

552
00:38:14,885 --> 00:38:17,607
Commander.
Status report.

553
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:22,818
All decks reporting in, Captain.
The Halkan survivors are safely on board.

554
00:38:22,938 --> 00:38:26,236
Shuttlecraft Galileo is
leaving sensor range.

555
00:38:32,318 --> 00:38:35,330
James T. Kirk chose his path.

556
00:38:35,706 --> 00:38:38,371
It is time we chose ours.

557
00:38:38,491 --> 00:38:39,964
Warp two, Ensign.

558
00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:41,889
Heading, sir?

559
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:47,942
Forward.

560
