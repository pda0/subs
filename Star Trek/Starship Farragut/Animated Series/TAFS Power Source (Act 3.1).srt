1
00:00:10,742 --> 00:00:12,281
Where are you taking us?

2
00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:14,898
To the brig, of course.

3
00:00:22,811 --> 00:00:24,233
Now, Mr. Prescott!

4
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,674
Good aim, Commander.

5
00:00:52,294 --> 00:00:53,741
Just because I’m a man of science

6
00:00:53,765 --> 00:00:55,817
doesn’t mean I can’t handle a phaser.

7
00:00:57,506 --> 00:00:58,997
Thanks, RT.

8
00:00:59,617 --> 00:01:00,677
Carter here.

9
00:01:00,743 --> 00:01:01,860
Just checking in, Jack.

10
00:01:01,884 --> 00:01:03,329
Is everything alright over there?

11
00:01:03,353 --> 00:01:05,791
It is now. We had a bit of an incident,

12
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:07,214
but everything’s under control.

13
00:01:07,474 --> 00:01:08,969
Tell Doc Holley to stand by

14
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:10,957
to receive 3 priority patients.

15
00:01:11,122 --> 00:01:13,703
Sir, Captain Glenn is gone.

16
00:01:13,727 --> 00:01:14,787
He must have slipped away

17
00:01:14,832 --> 00:01:16,366
while we were dealing with these guards.

18
00:01:16,653 --> 00:01:20,001
Correction, prepare for
two priority patients.

19
00:01:20,366 --> 00:01:23,121
We’ll be back momentarily. Carter out.

20
00:01:23,813 --> 00:01:25,251
Any thoughts, RT?

21
00:01:25,733 --> 00:01:28,550
It’s your hand, Jack. How
do you want to play it?

22
00:01:28,592 --> 00:01:31,238
I’m more worried about what
Glenn has up his sleeve.

23
00:01:31,304 --> 00:01:33,293
We don’t have time to track him down.

24
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:35,041
I’ll need you to start analyzing

25
00:01:35,107 --> 00:01:36,809
Glenn’s data on those machines.

26
00:01:37,394 --> 00:01:39,017
Judging by what we’ve seen already,

27
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:40,887
there isn’t much time.

28
00:01:40,954 --> 00:01:41,972
I’m on it.

29
00:01:42,193 --> 00:01:44,962
Mr. Prescott. I have a
feeling we’re going to need you

30
00:01:45,028 --> 00:01:47,835
to execute that hostile
takeover plan we discussed.

31
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:49,663
Let’s go check on
your guard and get back

32
00:01:49,687 --> 00:01:51,585
to the Farragut so you
can prepare your team.

33
00:01:51,965 --> 00:01:53,040
Very well, sir!

34
00:02:03,144 --> 00:02:04,830
Is it cold in here to you?

35
00:02:04,896 --> 00:02:06,981
It does seem like they’ve
turned the heat down a bit.

36
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:10,437
Computer, increase the
temperature by ten degrees.

37
00:02:11,247 --> 00:02:13,639
Why do you think these
guards were acting so bizarre?

38
00:02:14,036 --> 00:02:16,185
That’s what I’m trying
to find out, Ensign.

39
00:02:16,682 --> 00:02:18,257
Now if you’re through asking questions,

40
00:02:18,324 --> 00:02:20,770
maybe you can assist me with
the analysis of this data.

41
00:02:21,419 --> 00:02:22,877
Maybe I don’t want to help.

42
00:02:23,153 --> 00:02:25,439
I was supposed to be
taking the day off anyway.

43
00:02:25,463 --> 00:02:28,180
Are you refusing a direct
order from your superior?

44
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:31,929
What order? You said
“maybe” I could help you.

45
00:02:31,996 --> 00:02:34,007
Well, “maybe” I don’t want to.

46
00:02:34,538 --> 00:02:37,369
That’s true, you didn’t
actually order him.

47
00:02:37,848 --> 00:02:39,886
I don’t think I’m going
to assist you anymore!

48
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:42,345
You can work out this
problem by yourself!

49
00:02:42,742 --> 00:02:44,572
- What?!
- You heard me!

50
00:02:44,802 --> 00:02:47,749
Ensign, you are relieved of
duty and confined to quarters!

51
00:02:47,899 --> 00:02:50,362
Fine! See if you can do this without me!

52
00:02:53,323 --> 00:02:54,621
What have you got, RT?

53
00:02:54,687 --> 00:02:57,177
From the tone of your
message, it must be pretty big.

54
00:02:57,201 --> 00:02:58,738
You bet it is, Jack.

55
00:02:58,888 --> 00:02:59,950
Let’s have it.

56
00:02:59,974 --> 00:03:02,278
Well, we’ve been correct
all along about one thing.

57
00:03:02,302 --> 00:03:04,808
Those devices are drawing
the gases from the atmosphere

58
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:06,576
and using it as some sort of fuel.

59
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,101
The entire planet is
basically being turned

60
00:03:09,167 --> 00:03:10,739
into a gigantic power source.

61
00:03:11,481 --> 00:03:12,882
What in heaven’s name would anyone

62
00:03:12,949 --> 00:03:14,986
need with such a huge power source?

63
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:17,982
My analysis concludes
multiple possibilities.

64
00:03:18,048 --> 00:03:19,335
Things I never dreamed possible.

65
00:03:19,359 --> 00:03:22,234
Things that could change Starfleet
and the human race forever.

66
00:03:22,743 --> 00:03:23,787
I don’t follow.

67
00:03:23,812 --> 00:03:27,106
There’s more. Captain Glenn
has successfully established

68
00:03:27,172 --> 00:03:29,489
a remote connection to the
power generating mechanism.

69
00:03:29,555 --> 00:03:31,345
And he’s attempting to activate it.

70
00:03:32,675 --> 00:03:35,170
Can he do that? Does
he have the knowledge?

71
00:03:35,362 --> 00:03:36,743
Not in his state of mind.

72
00:03:36,809 --> 00:03:38,629
Well, I suppose there’s
a remote chance of

73
00:03:38,695 --> 00:03:40,995
him hitting the right
combination, but not likely.

74
00:03:41,062 --> 00:03:42,592
But if he tries?

75
00:03:42,658 --> 00:03:44,690
The results could be
disastrous for everything

76
00:03:44,714 --> 00:03:46,500
within a parsec of this system.

77
00:03:46,669 --> 00:03:48,294
That’s all I need to know.

78
00:03:48,444 --> 00:03:50,430
It’s imperative that we get both ships

79
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:52,906
as far away from this
planet as soon as possible.

80
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:54,801
- No!
- No?

81
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:55,959
We can’t leave yet.

82
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:57,378
Explain.

83
00:03:57,402 --> 00:03:59,481
Maybe Glenn can’t activate
the device properly,

84
00:03:59,552 --> 00:04:02,087
but I know I can. I must.

85
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:04,787
The scientific knowledge that
could be gained is enormous!

86
00:04:04,812 --> 00:04:06,463
We can’t risk it.

87
00:04:06,487 --> 00:04:08,970
I’m not going to abandon
this opportunity, Jack.

88
00:04:08,994 --> 00:04:10,801
This is what I was meant for.

89
00:04:10,825 --> 00:04:13,799
This is the reason I went into
sciences in the first place.

90
00:04:13,824 --> 00:04:15,767
I have to see this through!

91
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:17,478
We’re going to take over the Azrael

92
00:04:17,502 --> 00:04:20,507
and both ships are leaving
the system as soon as possible.

93
00:04:20,531 --> 00:04:22,397
This experiment is concluded.

94
00:04:22,421 --> 00:04:24,192
That’s an order, Mr. Tacket!

95
00:04:24,841 --> 00:04:26,792
Noooo! I won’t let you!

96
00:04:26,858 --> 00:04:29,497
Listen to yourself! Look at yourself!

97
00:04:29,521 --> 00:04:32,178
This isn’t you, RT! Snap out of it!

98
00:04:32,412 --> 00:04:35,292
Iím sorry. I donít
know what got into me.

99
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:37,208
It was like I wasn’t in control.

100
00:04:37,669 --> 00:04:39,414
It’s that damned planet!

101
00:04:39,848 --> 00:04:41,563
We’re getting out of here... right now.

102
00:04:42,284 --> 00:04:43,379
Carter to Prescott.

103
00:04:43,487 --> 00:04:44,549
*Prescott here.*

104
00:04:44,572 --> 00:04:46,330
Have your security team
in the transporter room

105
00:04:46,354 --> 00:04:48,760
on the double, armed and ready!

106
00:04:51,983 --> 00:04:54,552
Transporter room, prepare
to beam security detail

107
00:04:54,576 --> 00:04:56,593
to the Azrael bridge on my command.

108
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,979
Is it cold in here or what?

109
00:05:00,393 --> 00:05:03,679
Sir, the Azrael has
raised their shields.

110
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:06,686
Confirmed. Looks like
Glenn still has some sense

111
00:05:06,711 --> 00:05:07,828
of what’s going on around him.

112
00:05:10,505 --> 00:05:12,772
Lt. Taylor, where are you going?

113
00:05:13,467 --> 00:05:14,902
I’m taking a break.

114
00:05:14,927 --> 00:05:16,951
Time for a swift cuppa
and a spot of lunch.

115
00:05:16,975 --> 00:05:18,278
What’s it to you?!

116
00:05:18,911 --> 00:05:21,334
Return to your station
immediately, mister!

117
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:25,696
I’m sorry, sir. I really
don’t know what came over me.

118
00:05:26,152 --> 00:05:29,567
Mr. Thelin, I want a
precision attack on the Azrael.

119
00:05:29,922 --> 00:05:32,420
Minimum force necessary to
bring down their shields.

120
00:05:32,741 --> 00:05:35,662
As soon as they’re down,
cease fire immediately.

121
00:05:36,076 --> 00:05:37,641
Maneuvering thrusters only.

122
00:05:37,665 --> 00:05:39,405
Coming into position now, sir.

123
00:05:47,354 --> 00:05:48,359
Evasive!

124
00:05:48,384 --> 00:05:51,572
I can’t do it, sir. It’s too difficult.

125
00:05:51,998 --> 00:05:54,652
Focus, Thelin! Stay on him!

126
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:57,990
Jack, I’m reading a build-up
of energy from the planet!

127
00:05:58,539 --> 00:06:00,195
I’m aware of that, Robert!

128
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,687
Can someone turn up the damn heat

129
00:06:01,753 --> 00:06:03,334
in here so I can concentrate?!

130
00:06:08,454 --> 00:06:10,152
The Azrael shields are down!

131
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:13,009
Transporter room! Now!

132
00:06:13,692 --> 00:06:17,519
The Azrael... it’s firing phasers
and photon torpedoes again!

133
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,294
Shields are at sixty percent!

134
00:06:21,224 --> 00:06:24,348
Continue evasive maneuvers,
but don’t return fire!

135
00:06:24,372 --> 00:06:26,733
Just keep us safe for
a few moments longer!

136
00:06:38,739 --> 00:06:40,608
What are you doing here?!

137
00:06:41,331 --> 00:06:44,659
Jones, take these
trespassers to the brig!

138
00:07:04,601 --> 00:07:06,687
The Azrael has disarmed.

139
00:07:07,192 --> 00:07:08,405
Carter to Prescott.

140
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,513
*Prescott here.*

141
00:07:10,751 --> 00:07:14,120
I assume that the Azrael’s
crew was less than cooperative?

142
00:07:14,641 --> 00:07:19,201
On the contrary, sir,
they were very cooperative.

143
00:07:19,225 --> 00:07:20,727
*Well, don’t just stand there.*

144
00:07:20,793 --> 00:07:23,499
*Get that ship moving and
follow us out of the system.*

145
00:07:23,809 --> 00:07:24,850
Aye, sir.

146
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:27,188
Energy build-up is almost complete!

147
00:07:27,503 --> 00:07:30,084
Get us out of here! Warp factor six!
