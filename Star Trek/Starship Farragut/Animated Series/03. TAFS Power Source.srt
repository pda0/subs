00:01:29,348 --> 00:01:33,076
Captain’s log.
Stardate 6050.5

3
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,202
The Farragut has been ordered to the Chorus system

4
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:39,989
to locate the USS Azrael,
under the command of Captain Arron Glenn.

5
00:01:40,429 --> 00:01:45,178
The Azrael was investigating the recent
discovery of some unusual alien technology,

6
00:01:45,298 --> 00:01:46,787
deep in uncharted space.

7
00:01:47,151 --> 00:01:48,848
Just three days into our mission,

8
00:01:48,868 --> 00:01:51,490
all communications with the Azrael ceased.

9
00:01:51,756 --> 00:01:55,402
It is our mission to uncover the reason
for the communication disruption,

10
00:01:55,522 --> 00:01:57,915
and to offer any assistance
that may be required.

11
00:01:58,867 --> 00:02:02,295
Captain, I have a ship on intercept course,
approaching at warp 6.

12
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:04,362
Identification!

13
00:02:04,937 --> 00:02:06,346
A Federation starship.

14
00:02:07,015 --> 00:02:08,999
NCC-517

15
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,819
It’s the USS Azrael, sir.

16
00:02:10,939 --> 00:02:12,552
She’s dropping out of warp.

17
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:15,171
Helm, disengage warp engines.

18
00:02:15,429 --> 00:02:17,413
Hi, sir.
Cutting into impulse engines.

19
00:02:17,695 --> 00:02:19,256
Hailing frequencies.

20
00:02:20,104 --> 00:02:22,852
This is Captain John T. Carter,
of the starship Farragut.

21
00:02:23,251 --> 00:02:24,777
Acknowledge.

22
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:29,826
Status on that ship, RT.

23
00:02:30,202 --> 00:02:31,411
Nothing unusual.

24
00:02:31,531 --> 00:02:32,773
No malfunctions.

25
00:02:33,013 --> 00:02:34,434
Lifesigns normal.

26
00:02:34,669 --> 00:02:35,949
Captain Glenn,

27
00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:38,315
This is Captain John T. Carter
of the starship Farragut.

28
00:02:38,585 --> 00:02:40,311
Report your status!

29
00:02:40,431 --> 00:02:42,055
Do you require assistance?

30
00:02:43,027 --> 00:02:45,868
Captain, the Azrael is firing photon torpedoes.

31
00:02:58,742 --> 00:03:02,728
She’s making a room for it, sir.
Heading 3-60 mark zero. Warp factor 6.

32
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:05,112
Lay down pursuit course, Mr. Taylor.

33
00:03:05,232 --> 00:03:06,502
Match her speed!

34
00:03:06,622 --> 00:03:08,581
Hi, sir!
Pursuit course laid in.

35
00:03:08,701 --> 00:03:10,224
Engage!

36
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,064
The engines!
They’re not responding!

37
00:03:15,109 --> 00:03:17,434
- Engineering!
- Smithfield here.

38
00:03:17,554 --> 00:03:18,796
Damage report, Mike.

39
00:03:19,197 --> 00:03:21,498
Who ever that was,
they knew exactly where to hit us.

40
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,670
That attack took our  warp systems.

41
00:03:23,895 --> 00:03:25,245
How bad is it?

42
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,946
They did a nifty job of crippling us for the short term.

43
00:03:28,216 --> 00:03:29,284
But nothing major.

44
00:03:29,531 --> 00:03:32,349
I should be able to get us back online
in a few hours.

45
00:03:32,469 --> 00:03:34,228
That was the Azrael that fired on us,

46
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:35,896
and I need to find out why!

47
00:03:36,273 --> 00:03:38,868
Any chance of a... previse repair estimate?

48
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,834
I can cut that time in half,

49
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:43,347
provided that you stay away
from my engine room.

50
00:03:43,734 --> 00:03:45,296
You’ve got a deal.

51
00:03:45,872 --> 00:03:48,044
Doctor Holley,
report to the briefing room.

52
00:03:48,555 --> 00:03:51,326
RT, Mr. Prescott, you with me.

53
00:03:52,215 --> 00:03:55,350
Mr. Taylor, you have the conn.

54
00:04:01,221 --> 00:04:03,487
Just 3 days in the Azrael’s mission,

55
00:04:03,798 --> 00:04:05,583
and all communications went dark.

56
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:08,306
Her coming out to meet us in deep space

57
00:04:08,613 --> 00:04:11,513
means that she’s been receiving
Starfleet communications all along.

58
00:04:12,153 --> 00:04:13,468
They knew we were coming,

59
00:04:13,588 --> 00:04:16,109
and hitted us off before
we can reach the Chorus system.

60
00:04:16,574 --> 00:04:19,709
A premeditated assault on another Federation vessel

61
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:21,065
Does it make sense?

62
00:04:21,922 --> 00:04:23,894
Glenn’s service record is flawless

63
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:26,806
He’s a man at unswerving character.

64
00:04:27,194 --> 00:04:29,839
You’ve worked with captain Glenn
before, Mr Prescott?

65
00:04:30,158 --> 00:04:32,824
A training mission, sir.
Starfleet Academy.

66
00:04:33,111 --> 00:04:34,473
Very good!

67
00:04:34,884 --> 00:04:37,461
Starfleet has given us
roll at logs and data

68
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:39,432
from the Azrael’s 3 day mission

69
00:04:39,456 --> 00:04:40,796
for other analysis.

70
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:44,940
My initial impression is that he may
not be responsible for his actions.

71
00:04:45,457 --> 00:04:48,251
Watch closely.
I want everyone’s input.

72
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:54,075
Captain’s log,
Stardate 6047.2

73
00:04:55,026 --> 00:04:58,783
The strange energy emanating from the fifth planet in the system

74
00:04:58,806 --> 00:05:01,031
has led us to an incredible discovery

75
00:05:01,679 --> 00:05:05,155
advanced alien devices in orbit of the gas giant

76
00:05:05,413 --> 00:05:08,149
seem to be joining gases from the atmosphere.

77
00:05:08,674 --> 00:05:11,199
This massive, spherical construction

78
00:05:11,211 --> 00:05:14,087
appear to be using the gases as some form of fuel.

79
00:05:14,363 --> 00:05:16,969
Preliminary scans indicate that these devices

80
00:05:16,993 --> 00:05:19,142
are generating the strange energy emissions

81
00:05:19,153 --> 00:05:20,692
permeating the system.

82
00:05:21,378 --> 00:05:22,540
Captain’s log.

83
00:05:22,552 --> 00:05:24,701
Stardate 6048.4

84
00:05:25,577 --> 00:05:27,644
My analysis of the... uh...

85
00:05:27,937 --> 00:05:31,742
...alien devices surrounding Chorus 5
is producing some...

86
00:05:32,364 --> 00:05:34,301
...interesting results.

87
00:05:34,858 --> 00:05:38,181
More and more I’m starting to see
the relationship between...

88
00:05:38,736 --> 00:05:41,530
...the machines in orbit and the... uh...

89
00:05:41,531 --> 00:05:43,386
...gases in the atmosphere.

90
00:05:44,126 --> 00:05:45,934
If I can just gain...

91
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:48,148
...access to the internal systems...

92
00:05:48,606 --> 00:05:50,308
...of these machines...

93
00:05:50,428 --> 00:05:53,609
...I am certain that I would
be able to unlock their secret.

94
00:05:54,184 --> 00:05:56,075
I will continue to...

95
00:05:56,318 --> 00:05:57,774
...collect the data...

96
00:05:57,894 --> 00:05:59,942
...and work too hard
in high policies.

97
00:06:00,928 --> 00:06:02,654
Our mission to Chorus 5

98
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:05,127
...has shielded phenomenal results.

99
00:06:06,001 --> 00:06:08,655
I’ve learned more then I could have hoped for.

100
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:12,124
Everything is becoming clear!

101
00:06:12,688 --> 00:06:15,259
I realize my purpose, now.

102
00:06:15,379 --> 00:06:19,550
and I intend to see this experiment through
to the ultimate conclusion!

103
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:23,064
Nothing shall stand in my way! Nothing!

104
00:06:24,743 --> 00:06:26,351
That’s the last log entry.

105
00:06:26,704 --> 00:06:27,819
Thoughts?

106
00:06:27,831 --> 00:06:30,672
There was a clear change of personality,
if I ever saw one.

107
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:34,699
From increasing signs of stress and fatigue
to an obsessive nature.

108
00:06:35,267 --> 00:06:37,087
Did you noticed his eyes...

109
00:06:37,207 --> 00:06:39,159
...an almost red as glow.

110
00:06:39,418 --> 00:06:41,062
No tell in what’s affecting him.

111
00:06:41,182 --> 00:06:42,642
What state of mind he’s in?

112
00:06:42,762 --> 00:06:44,427
Or the rest of his crew!

113
00:06:44,547 --> 00:06:47,921
No one on that ship has made any attempt
to get a message to the Starfleet.

114
00:06:48,173 --> 00:06:49,958
And they’ve had plenty of opportunity.

115
00:06:49,968 --> 00:06:53,379
His attack on Farragut was deliberately
designed to put us out of commission,

116
00:06:53,499 --> 00:06:55,029
but not to destroy us.

117
00:06:55,344 --> 00:06:57,716
He want’s to delay us, and that’s all.

118
00:06:57,974 --> 00:07:00,906
- For what purpose?
- That alien technology.

119
00:07:01,328 --> 00:07:03,242
It looks like he was on to something.

120
00:07:03,362 --> 00:07:05,161
Maybe he just want
to buy a little more time.

121
00:07:05,607 --> 00:07:08,543
Why the strange behavior?
The sudden obsession?

122
00:07:08,663 --> 00:07:11,279
The abrupt disinterest on logging his progress?

123
00:07:11,767 --> 00:07:14,151
Could there be an alien force at work here?

124
00:07:14,503 --> 00:07:16,576
You mean something we haven’t seen on these logs?

125
00:07:17,198 --> 00:07:21,002
Well, I think he’d be giving something away
if he made contact with an alien presence.

126
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:24,266
I’m more inclined to believe
that those unusual energy vestige

127
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,886
may be responsible for his condition.

128
00:07:26,203 --> 00:07:29,256
Which could put Farragut at risk
as soon as we get on range.

129
00:07:29,678 --> 00:07:33,189
I want you to examine these logs
and associated data in more detail.

130
00:07:33,471 --> 00:07:35,855
See what you income out with before we get under way.

131
00:07:36,647 --> 00:07:39,659
Mr. Prescott,
Brief your men on the situation

132
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:42,254
and prepare them for
potential hostile encounter.

133
00:07:42,606 --> 00:07:45,934
We may need to beam aboard
the Azrael and take it by force.

134
00:07:46,054 --> 00:07:47,367
Very well, sir.

135
00:07:47,672 --> 00:07:48,776
Doctor,

136
00:07:48,799 --> 00:07:51,653
You can assist Comander Tacket
by analyzing that energy.

137
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:53,541
Find out if we’re at risk,

138
00:07:53,661 --> 00:07:55,786
and what you can do
to conter-act it’s effect.

139
00:07:56,097 --> 00:07:57,588
Hi, sir.

140
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:58,915
Dismissed.

141
00:08:04,082 --> 00:08:07,874
Remember that we are dealing
with another starfleet ship and crew.

142
00:08:07,994 --> 00:08:11,162
The attack on the Farragut
disabled our warp system only.

143
00:08:11,703 --> 00:08:13,946
No other damage was inflicted.

144
00:08:14,515 --> 00:08:17,556
As far as the crew as concern we can’t assume anything.

145
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:21,072
Whatever is driving their actions
cannot as yet be determined.

146
00:08:21,192 --> 00:08:23,813
But it appears to be causing
a progressive change.

147
00:08:24,177 --> 00:08:27,118
I’m counting on each of you to hold your emotions in check,

148
00:08:27,238 --> 00:08:29,995
and to fight any strange urge that you may experience.

149
00:08:30,847 --> 00:08:33,935
The captain may be setting us in to take control of the Azrael.

150
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:37,311
In the mean time we remain
on red alert readiness.

151
00:08:38,238 --> 00:08:39,729
Dismissed!

152
00:08:46,594 --> 00:08:49,002
It was an honor to serve
under you, Captain Glenn.

153
00:08:49,518 --> 00:08:51,632
I’ll never forget that
first training mission.

154
00:08:51,878 --> 00:08:53,440
I learned a lot from you.

155
00:08:53,771 --> 00:08:57,423
I was looking forward to seen you again and
reverencing all my time at the Academy.

156
00:09:07,694 --> 00:09:10,547
- How you’re coming, Mr. Galway?
- Almost there, sir.

157
00:09:11,886 --> 00:09:14,293
Just... one... more...

158
00:09:14,413 --> 00:09:15,621
Ouch!

159
00:09:15,633 --> 00:09:17,077
Are you OK?

160
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,709
Fine, sir.

161
00:09:18,829 --> 00:09:20,717
just a lapse in concentration.

162
00:09:21,556 --> 00:09:23,775
When I get a hold on that Captain Glenn,

163
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:25,924
he’s gonna be answering to me personally.

164
00:09:26,305 --> 00:09:29,699
For damage to the warp drive?
Or myself electrocution?

165
00:09:30,673 --> 00:09:32,140
Both!

166
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,346
I believe that does it.

167
00:09:42,186 --> 00:09:43,994
And at record time!

168
00:09:44,276 --> 00:09:46,142
Engineering to bridge.

169
00:09:46,395 --> 00:09:49,002
- Bridge here.
- We’re back online, captain.

170
00:09:49,236 --> 00:09:51,538
Full warp capability as in your command.

171
00:09:51,948 --> 00:09:53,099
Thanks, Mike!

172
00:09:53,314 --> 00:09:57,553
Mr. Taylor, lay in a course to
the Chorus system. Warp factor 6.

173
00:09:58,328 --> 00:10:00,656
- Course laid in, sir.
- Engage.

174
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:14,160
Captain’s Log, stardate: 6050.8.

175
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,920
En route to the Quorus system,

176
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:19,780
we were intercepted by the Azrael
and fired upon unexpectedly.

177
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,120
The attack was specifically designed
to knock out our warp systems,

178
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,210
which we believe was intended to
delay our reaching the fifth planet.

179
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,270
After relatively quick repairs,

180
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:32,770
we resumed our original course and
now have arrived at Quorus Five.

181
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:35,580
The Azrael is holding its
position near the gas giant

182
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,840
and has not made a
move since our arrival.

183
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,210
Magnify.

184
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:45,960
Amazing!

185
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:47,620
Fascinating!

186
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:49,570
Analysis, RT.

187
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:53,580
Those devices seem to be using the
entire planet as a source of fuel

188
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,830
to create a strange type of
energy that I can’t identify.

189
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,670
Some residual energy is escaping
the planet’s gravitational pull

190
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,250
and penetrating both
Azrael and Farragut.

191
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,720
Our shields?

192
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:07,160
They appear to have no effect
on repelling the energy.

193
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,790
What is your threat assessment?

194
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,960
Unknown. This is unlike
anything I’ve seen before.

195
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:13,700
Our sensors aren’t
picking up anything new

196
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:15,110
that we haven’t been able to analyze

197
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:17,290
from top to bottom
from the Azrael feeds.

198
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,220
I was afraid of that.

199
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,800
Hail the Azrael. Let’s
see if they’ll talk.

200
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:26,230
Farragut to Azrael, do you read?

201
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:36,060
Sir, I’m getting something...
I mean someone, but...

202
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,140
What is it?

203
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:41,510
This... person is ordering us
to leave the system immediately.

204
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:42,740
Put me on.

205
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:47,780
Azrael, this is Captain John
T. Carter of the USS Farragut.

206
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,270
What’s your situation?

207
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:52,820
*This is Commodore Sheila
Johnson of the USS Azrael.*

208
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:56,490
*As I outrank you and, quite frankly,
can outthink and outfight you,*

209
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,170
*I hereby order you to
hightail it out of this system*

210
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,700
*before I take measures
to destroy your ship!*

211
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:03,140
Commodore who?

212
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:06,660
Look, I don’t care who
the hell you think you are,

213
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:09,170
put me through to
Captain Glenn immediately!

214
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:12,680
*You have ten minutes to comply
with my order! Azrael out!*

215
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:17,190
I might be mistaken, but
I don’t recall mention of

216
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:19,710
a Commodore Johnson
serving on the Azrael.

217
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,310
No, sir. However, there
is an Ensign Sheila Johnson

218
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:25,410
serving as the ship’s Comm Officer.

219
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:26,860
Ensign?

220
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,480
Captain, the Azrael’s shields are down.

221
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:33,090
Very odd for a ship
planning to attack us.

222
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:36,130
Any chance you can pinpoint
Captain Glenn’s location?

223
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,640
I could if we had access
to Glenn’s medical records.

224
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:42,460
A narrow band sensor array is capable

225
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:44,480
of picking up a unique bio signature.

226
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,620
Those records would be available
in the Azrael’s databanks.

227
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,200
I should be able to access them

228
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,200
with command level override codes.

229
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,410
If they haven’t locked out access.

230
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:55,130
Let’s give it a try.

231
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:58,900
*Access granted.*

232
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:02,850
Computer, download medical
records for Captain Aaron Glenn

233
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,930
and tie into the ship’s sensor array.

234
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,270
*Working.*

235
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:11,200
*Task complete.*

236
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:12,880
She’s all yours, RT.

237
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:20,130
Got him. He’s in the
Science Lab on deck five.

238
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,680
Mike, report to the bridge.

239
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,670
We’re beaming over to the Azrael.

240
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,080
You’re in command.

241
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:30,670
Mr. Prescott, meet us in the
transporter room with one of your staff.

242
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:45,570
Does it seem excessively
hot in here to you, Captain?

243
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:48,440
It must be over forty
degrees Celsius in here.

244
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,060
Intruders!

245
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,140
Get them!

246
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,310
Phasers on stun.

247
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:07,600
Call security!

248
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:10,870
No affect. Heavy stun.

249
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,040
Did you see their eyes?

250
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,890
It’s a good chance that
the energy from Quorus Five

251
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:21,930
is causing the abnormal
behaviors and appearances.

252
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,250
And it’s going to
begin affecting us soon.

253
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,420
Right, no time to waste.

254
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,120
Let’s get to Glenn and get some answers.

255
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,980
Commander, we’re receiving
another communication

256
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:47,580
from the alleged “Commodore”
Johnson. Should I respond?

257
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:50,340
No. Maintain communication
silence for the moment

258
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:51,990
while Jack and his team are on board.

259
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:55,830
Mr. Thelin, is there any
change in the Azrael’s status?

260
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:59,000
No, sir. It’s... wait a second.

261
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:00,250
That’s odd.

262
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:01,340
What is it?

263
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:04,450
I don’t quite know. My
instruments seem to be acting up.

264
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,020
I’m reading wild
fluctuations in our position.

265
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,630
One second it’s showing
where we’re supposed to be

266
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,900
and the next it has us
somewhere else completely.

267
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:13,690
It’s not just you.

268
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:16,680
I’m seeing some strange
anomalies here as well.

269
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:19,570
Every time I try to correct
it, it just goes off again.

270
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:29,110
Smithfield to Galway.

271
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,190
*Galway here.*

272
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:31,690
What’s going on down there?

273
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:33,980
We’re experiencing some
instrumentation failures.

274
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:36,200
I’m registering multiple
failures in most of

275
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:38,400
the primary, secondary,
and tertiary systems.

276
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:41,500
But it’s sporadic...
It’s jumping around.

277
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,460
*Run diagnostics on all systems.*

278
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,790
*I want to know why my ship is acting up!*

279
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:49,120
Diagnostics aren’t working
either. I need your help fast

280
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,330
or we’re going to lose
environmental systems too!

281
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,470
On my way.

282
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,480
Mr. Thelin, you have the con.

283
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:05,440
Whoa! What just caused that?

284
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:08,040
I can’t nail it down.
Every time I try to

285
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,780
compensate for one system,
another one goes down.

286
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,190
This is getting us nowhere.

287
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,640
Agreed.

288
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:22,610
Let’s shut down all systems and

289
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:24,540
bring them back up under manual control.

290
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,100
We’ll route minimal power to

291
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,060
non-critical systems and lock
them down on a fixed setting.

292
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,920
Alright. Let’s do it.

293
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:47,170
That seems to have done
the trick... For the moment.

294
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,920
Congratulations, Chief.

295
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,030
Thanks.

296
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,560
Don’t get too comfortable though.

297
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,660
I want you to monitor
these systems constantly.

298
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,220
Advise me of anything
unusual. I’ll be on the bridge.

299
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,520
Aye, sir.

300
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:08,890
Why can’t I solve this? It’s all here...

301
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:14,480
I have all I need... I
must solve it... I must...

302
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:16,830
Captain Glenn?

303
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:21,930
And you are...?

304
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:25,930
Carter, Sir. Captain John T.
Carter of the USS Farragut.

305
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,360
I don’t remember inviting you!

306
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:30,930
Do you want to explain to
me why you fired on my ship?

307
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,900
Nonsense. I didn’t fire on anyone!

308
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,450
And I strongly suggest
that you leave my ship

309
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,020
before I’m forced to
deal with you personally!

310
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:42,410
What’s the big experiment,
Glenn? What are you doing here?

311
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,330
You wouldn’t understand!

312
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,250
RT?

313
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:50,240
He is tapped into those
devices orbiting Quorus Five.

314
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:54,310
They appear to be part of a network
of machines all working in concert.

315
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,550
But for what purpose, I can’t say.

316
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,480
Alright, that’s it Glenn.

317
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:00,870
You will relinquish
command to my Security Chief

318
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,140
and accompany me
peacefully to the Farragut.

319
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,190
The Azrael will then
follow us out of the system.

320
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,250
Go away!

321
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,930
I have important research
and I cannot be disturbed!

322
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,070
Let me try, sir.

323
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:16,990
Captain Glenn, it’s me, Henry Prescott.

324
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:20,970
Starfleet Academy training
mission to Altair Six?

325
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:24,560
You were my commanding
officer on that mission...

326
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:28,820
My only mission is
to solve this mystery!

327
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:31,120
And I don’t care who you are!

328
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,340
Mr. Prescott, Captain
Glenn is under arrest.

329
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,000
Take him into custody, please.

330
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:40,370
Aye, sir.

331
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:44,170
Captain Glenn, please come with me.

332
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:48,020
I... am not going anywhere.

333
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:03,620
Sorry, Mr. Prescott. I know it
must have been difficult to see

334
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,010
your former commanding officer
behaving behaving like that.

335
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,470
Yes, sir, it was.

336
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:11,790
Let’s get him back to the Farragut
and see if we can sort this out.

337
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,900
Where are you taking us?

338
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,510
To the brig, of course.

339
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:48,850
Now, Mr. Prescott!

340
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,290
Good aim, Commander.

341
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:18,360
Just because I’m a man of science

342
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,430
doesn’t mean I can’t handle a phaser.

343
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,610
Thanks, RT.

344
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:25,290
Carter here.

345
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,480
Just checking in, Jack.

346
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,940
Is everything alright over there?

347
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:30,410
It is now. We had a bit of an incident,

348
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,830
but everything’s under control.

349
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:33,580
Tell Doc Holley to stand by

350
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,570
to receive 3 priority patients.

351
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:38,320
Sir, Captain Glenn is gone.

352
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,400
He must have slipped away

353
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:40,980
while we were dealing with these guards.

354
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:44,620
Correction, prepare for
two priority patients.

355
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,740
We’ll be back momentarily. Carter out.

356
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:49,870
Any thoughts, RT?

357
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:53,170
It’s your hand, Jack. How
do you want to play it?

358
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,850
I’m more worried about what
Glenn has up his sleeve.

359
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,910
We don’t have time to track him down.

360
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:59,660
I’ll need you to start analyzing

361
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,420
Glenn’s data on those machines.

362
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,630
Judging by what we’ve seen already,

363
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,500
there isn’t much time.

364
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:06,590
I’m on it.

365
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:09,580
Mr. Prescott. I have a
feeling we’re going to need you

366
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,450
to execute that hostile
takeover plan we discussed.

367
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:14,280
Let’s go check on
your guard and get back

368
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,200
to the Farragut so you
can prepare your team.

369
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:17,660
Very well, sir!

370
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,450
Is it cold in here to you?

371
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:31,600
It does seem like they’ve
turned the heat down a bit.

372
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:35,050
Computer, increase the
temperature by ten degrees.

373
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:38,250
Why do you think these
guards were acting so bizarre?

374
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:40,800
That’s what I’m trying
to find out, Ensign.

375
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,870
Now if you’re through asking questions,

376
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:45,390
maybe you can assist me with
the analysis of this data.

377
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,490
Maybe I don’t want to help.

378
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:50,050
I was supposed to be
taking the day off anyway.

379
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,800
Are you refusing a direct
order from your superior?

380
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:56,540
What order? You said
“maybe” I could help you.

381
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:58,620
Well, “maybe” I don’t want to.

382
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:01,980
That’s true, you didn’t
actually order him.

383
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,500
I don’t think I’m going
to assist you anymore!

384
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,960
You can work out this
problem by yourself!

385
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,190
- What?!
- You heard me!

386
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:12,360
Ensign, you are relieved of
duty and confined to quarters!

387
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:14,980
Fine! See if you can do this without me!

388
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,240
What have you got, RT?

389
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,790
From the tone of your
message, it must be pretty big.

390
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,350
You bet it is, Jack.

391
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,570
Let’s have it.

392
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:26,890
Well, we’ve been correct
all along about one thing.

393
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,420
Those devices are drawing
the gases from the atmosphere

394
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:31,190
and using it as some sort of fuel.

395
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:33,720
The entire planet is
basically being turned

396
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,350
into a gigantic power source.

397
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,500
What in heaven’s name would anyone

398
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,600
need with such a huge power source?

399
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:42,600
My analysis concludes
multiple possibilities.

400
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,950
Things I never dreamed possible.

401
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:46,850
Things that could change Starfleet
and the human race forever.

402
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,400
I don’t follow.

403
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:51,720
There’s more. Captain Glenn
has successfully established

404
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:54,100
a remote connection to the
power generating mechanism.

405
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:55,960
And he’s attempting to activate it.

406
00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:59,790
Can he do that? Does
he have the knowledge?

407
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,360
Not in his state of mind.

408
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:03,240
Well, I suppose there’s
a remote chance of

409
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:05,610
him hitting the right
combination, but not likely.

410
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,210
But if he tries?

411
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:09,310
The results could be
disastrous for everything

412
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:11,120
within a parsec of this system.

413
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,910
That’s all I need to know.

414
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,050
It’s imperative that we get both ships

415
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:17,520
as far away from this
planet as soon as possible.

416
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:19,420
- No!
- No?

417
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,570
We can’t leave yet.

418
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:21,990
Explain.

419
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,100
Maybe Glenn can’t activate
the device properly,

420
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:26,700
but I know I can. I must.

421
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:29,400
The scientific knowledge that
could be gained is enormous!

422
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:31,080
We can’t risk it.

423
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,590
I’m not going to abandon
this opportunity, Jack.

424
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:35,420
This is what I was meant for.

425
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,410
This is the reason I went into
sciences in the first place.

426
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,380
I have to see this through!

427
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:42,090
We’re going to take over the Azrael

428
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:45,120
and both ships are leaving
the system as soon as possible.

429
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:47,010
This experiment is concluded.

430
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,810
That’s an order, Mr. Tacket!

431
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,410
Noooo! I won’t let you!

432
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:54,110
Listen to yourself! Look at yourself!

433
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:56,790
This isn’t you, RT! Snap out of it!

434
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:59,910
Iím sorry. I donít
know what got into me.

435
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:01,820
It was like I wasn’t in control.

436
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,030
It’s that damned planet!

437
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,180
We’re getting out of here... right now.

438
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:07,990
Carter to Prescott.

439
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,160
*Prescott here.*

440
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:10,950
Have your security team
in the transporter room

441
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:13,380
on the double, armed and ready!

442
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,170
Transporter room, prepare
to beam security detail

443
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:21,210
to the Azrael bridge on my command.

444
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,590
Is it cold in here or what?

445
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:28,290
Sir, the Azrael has
raised their shields.

446
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,300
Confirmed. Looks like
Glenn still has some sense

447
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:32,440
of what’s going on around him.

448
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,390
Lt. Taylor, where are you going?

449
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,520
I’m taking a break.

450
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:41,570
Time for a swift cuppa
and a spot of lunch.

451
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:42,890
What’s it to you?!

452
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:45,950
Return to your station
immediately, mister!

453
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:50,310
I’m sorry, sir. I really
don’t know what came over me.

454
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:54,180
Mr. Thelin, I want a
precision attack on the Azrael.

455
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:57,040
Minimum force necessary to
bring down their shields.

456
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,280
As soon as they’re down,
cease fire immediately.

457
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:02,260
Maneuvering thrusters only.

458
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,020
Coming into position now, sir.

459
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:12,970
Evasive!

460
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,190
I can’t do it, sir. It’s too difficult.

461
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:19,270
Focus, Thelin! Stay on him!

462
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:22,610
Jack, I’m reading a build-up
of energy from the planet!

463
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:24,810
I’m aware of that, Robert!

464
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,300
Can someone turn up the damn heat

465
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:27,950
in here so I can concentrate?!

466
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,770
The Azrael shields are down!

467
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:37,620
Transporter room! Now!

468
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:42,130
The Azrael... it’s firing phasers
and photon torpedoes again!

469
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,910
Shields are at sixty percent!

470
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,960
Continue evasive maneuvers,
but don’t return fire!

471
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:51,350
Just keep us safe for
a few moments longer!

472
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:05,220
What are you doing here?!

473
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:09,270
Jones, take these
trespassers to the brig!

474
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,300
The Azrael has disarmed.

475
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:33,020
Carter to Prescott.

476
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,130
*Prescott here.*

477
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:38,740
I assume that the Azrael’s
crew was less than cooperative?

478
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:43,820
On the contrary, sir,
they were very cooperative.

479
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,340
*Well, don’t just stand there.*

480
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:48,110
*Get that ship moving and
follow us out of the system.*

481
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:49,470
Aye, sir.

482
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:51,800
Energy build-up is almost complete!

483
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,700
Get us out of here! Warp factor six!

484
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,930
Captain’s log, supplemental.

485
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,670
After surviving the massive

486
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,690
planetary explosion of Quorus Five,

487
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,500
Captain Glenn is making
preparations to depart.

488
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,740
His mission is to resume exploration

489
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:35,500
of the remnants of that system.

490
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,930
Starfleet hopes that
they will uncover answers

491
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,210
to some very disconcerting questions.

492
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,340
Thanks once again for pulling
us out of the jam back there.

493
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,420
I feel pretty foolish.

494
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:47,110
I almost led us all to our destruction

495
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,830
over a petty obsession.

496
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:50,900
Doctor Holley is sure
that you and your crew

497
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:52,960
were not responsible for your actions.

498
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,150
And yet she couldn’t produce evidence

499
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:57,510
of any medical reason for our condition.

500
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,320
We all suffered something from being

501
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:01,400
exposed to that alien technology.

502
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:04,960
You, Mr. Prescott? I
don’t recall noticing

503
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,300
you having any difficulties.

504
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,250
My particular training should have

505
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,050
allowed me to keep it under control.

506
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:12,490
However, my performance in the lab

507
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:14,470
would seem to indicate otherwise.

508
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:17,620
Well, in the end you
came through for us.

509
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:21,660
Yes. Captain Glenn, I’m... sorry

510
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,910
for what happened on the Azrael bridge.

511
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,620
I hope you don’t think less of me.

512
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:29,540
On the contrary. You’ve
once again demonstrated

513
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,160
excellence in the
performance of your duty.

514
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:35,060
Anyway, the whole thing seems

515
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,800
somehow unreal now.

516
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:39,030
Thank you, sir.

517
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:41,940
I’m just sorry your
Smithfield couldn’t be here.

518
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,670
I was rather looking
forward to meeting her.

519
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:47,640
No, sir, you might
not enjoy that meeting.

520
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,200
She’s still in her engine
room trying to repair

521
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:52,450
the mess that she thinks you caused.

522
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:54,390
The last time I saw
her she was grumbling

523
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,700
something that included
your name and some

524
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:59,200
choice words that I had to look up.

525
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:16,140
Come.

526
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:22,230
Don’t tell me you forgot about

527
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:23,900
our Friday night poker game.

528
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,770
Well, to tell you the truth...

529
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,990
He did.

530
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:30,800
I know that look.

531
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:32,520
You’ve got something on your mind.

532
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:33,960
Don’t we all?

533
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,170
We were witness to an amazing display

534
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,170
of power and an
incredible feat of genius.

535
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,140
I can’t help but wonder if there are

536
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:44,200
more remnants of that
unusual alien technology.

537
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:46,040
My money says there is,

538
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,420
but what I’m more curious about

539
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,490
is what that technology was used for.

540
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:52,130
When you were insisting
that we activate the device

541
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:53,250
you seemed pretty close

542
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:54,880
to some sort of revelation.

543
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:56,560
It’s like a dream now.

544
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,450
You know how the most ridiculous things

545
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,280
can seem logical when
you’re having a dream,

546
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,260
but when you wake up you
can’t make sense of it

547
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,420
no matter how hard you try?

548
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,020
The way my engineering
systems kept acting up...

549
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:10,330
that certainly feels more
like a dream now than reality.

550
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,820
At least I wish it was a dream.

551
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,960
Well, Prescott thinks it was meant

552
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:17,040
to be some sort of doomsday weapon.

553
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:19,490
I’d rather think that it
had a more positive use.

554
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:22,290
Quorus Four is a good
orbital distance from the sun

555
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,320
and with a little help
could be terraformed

556
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:26,300
into a nice little habitable planet.

557
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:28,720
All it would need is a
good secondary energy source

558
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:31,130
to maintain an ideal
Class M environment.

559
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:34,860
A logical possibility
if a bit unromantic.

560
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:36,720
I can imagine that power being used

561
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:40,040
to fuel perhaps a massive
teleportation device...

562
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:42,490
one that could send entire civilizations

563
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:44,960
to the other side of the known universe.

564
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:49,490
Talk about the ultimate
mission of first contact...

565
