Captain’s log.
Stardate 6050.5

3
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,202
The Farragut has been ordered to the Chorus system

4
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:39,989
to locate the USS Azrael,
under the command of Captain Arron Glenn.

5
00:01:40,429 --> 00:01:45,178
The Azrael was investigating the recent
discovery of some unusual alien technology,

6
00:01:45,298 --> 00:01:46,787
deep in uncharted space.

7
00:01:47,151 --> 00:01:48,848
Just three days into our mission,

8
00:01:48,868 --> 00:01:51,490
all communications with the Azrael ceased.

9
00:01:51,756 --> 00:01:55,402
It is our mission to uncover the reason
for the communication disruption,

10
00:01:55,522 --> 00:01:57,915
and to offer any assistance
that may be required.

11
00:01:58,867 --> 00:02:02,295
Captain, I have a ship on intercept course,
approaching at warp 6.

12
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:04,362
Identification!

13
00:02:04,937 --> 00:02:06,346
A Federation starship.

14
00:02:07,015 --> 00:02:08,999
NCC-517

15
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,819
It’s the USS Azrael, sir.

16
00:02:10,939 --> 00:02:12,552
She’s dropping out of warp.

17
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:15,171
Helm, disengage warp engines.

18
00:02:15,429 --> 00:02:17,413
Hi, sir.
Cutting into impulse engines.

19
00:02:17,695 --> 00:02:19,256
Hailing frequencies.

20
00:02:20,104 --> 00:02:22,852
This is Captain John T. Carter,
of the starship Farragut.

21
00:02:23,251 --> 00:02:24,777
Acknowledge.

22
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:29,826
Status on that ship, RT.

23
00:02:30,202 --> 00:02:31,411
Nothing unusual.

24
00:02:31,531 --> 00:02:32,773
No malfunctions.

25
00:02:33,013 --> 00:02:34,434
Lifesigns normal.

26
00:02:34,669 --> 00:02:35,949
Captain Glenn,

27
00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:38,315
This is Captain John T. Carter
of the starship Farragut.

28
00:02:38,585 --> 00:02:40,311
Report your status!

29
00:02:40,431 --> 00:02:42,055
Do you require assistance?

30
00:02:43,027 --> 00:02:45,868
Captain, the Azrael is firing photon torpedoes.

31
00:02:58,742 --> 00:03:02,728
She’s making a room for it, sir.
Heading 3-60 mark zero. Warp factor 6.

32
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:05,112
Lay down pursuit course, Mr. Taylor.

33
00:03:05,232 --> 00:03:06,502
Match her speed!

34
00:03:06,622 --> 00:03:08,581
Hi, sir!
Pursuit course laid in.

35
00:03:08,701 --> 00:03:10,224
Engage!

36
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,064
The engines!
They’re not responding!

37
00:03:15,109 --> 00:03:17,434
- Engineering!
- Smithfield here.

38
00:03:17,554 --> 00:03:18,796
Damage report, Mike.

39
00:03:19,197 --> 00:03:21,498
Who ever that was,
they knew exactly where to hit us.

40
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,670
That attack took our  warp systems.

41
00:03:23,895 --> 00:03:25,245
How bad is it?

42
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,946
They did a nifty job of crippling us for the short term.

43
00:03:28,216 --> 00:03:29,284
But nothing major.

44
00:03:29,531 --> 00:03:32,349
I should be able to get us back online
in a few hours.

45
00:03:32,469 --> 00:03:34,228
That was the Azrael that fired on us,

46
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:35,896
and I need to find out why!

47
00:03:36,273 --> 00:03:38,868
Any chance of a... previse repair estimate?

48
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,834
I can cut that time in half,

49
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:43,347
provided that you stay away
from my engine room.

50
00:03:43,734 --> 00:03:45,296
You’ve got a deal.

51
00:03:45,872 --> 00:03:48,044
Doctor Holley,
report to the briefing room.

52
00:03:48,555 --> 00:03:51,326
RT, Mr. Prescott, you with me.

53
00:03:52,215 --> 00:03:55,350
Mr. Taylor, you have the conn.

54
00:04:01,221 --> 00:04:03,487
Just 3 days in the Azrael’s mission,

55
00:04:03,798 --> 00:04:05,583
and all communications went dark.

56
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:08,306
Her coming out to meet us in deep space

57
00:04:08,613 --> 00:04:11,513
means that she’s been receiving
Starfleet communications all along.

58
00:04:12,153 --> 00:04:13,468
They knew we were coming,

59
00:04:13,588 --> 00:04:16,109
and hitted us off before
we can reach the Chorus system.

60
00:04:16,574 --> 00:04:19,709
A premeditated assault on another Federation vessel

61
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:21,065
Does it make sense?

62
00:04:21,922 --> 00:04:23,894
Glenn’s service record is flawless

63
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:26,806
He’s a man at unswerving character.

64
00:04:27,194 --> 00:04:29,839
You’ve worked with captain Glenn
before, Mr Prescott?

65
00:04:30,158 --> 00:04:32,824
A training mission, sir.
Starfleet Academy.

66
00:04:33,111 --> 00:04:34,473
Very good!

67
00:04:34,884 --> 00:04:37,461
Starfleet has given us
roll at logs and data

68
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:39,432
from the Azrael’s 3 day mission

69
00:04:39,456 --> 00:04:40,796
for other analysis.

70
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:44,940
My initial impression is that he may
not be responsible for his actions.

71
00:04:45,457 --> 00:04:48,251
Watch closely.
I want everyone’s input.

72
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:54,075
Captain’s log,
Stardate 6047.2

73
00:04:55,026 --> 00:04:58,783
The strange energy emanating from the fifth planet in the system

74
00:04:58,806 --> 00:05:01,031
has led us to an incredible discovery

75
00:05:01,679 --> 00:05:05,155
advanced alien devices in orbit of the gas giant

76
00:05:05,413 --> 00:05:08,149
seem to be joining gases from the atmosphere.

77
00:05:08,674 --> 00:05:11,199
This massive, spherical construction

78
00:05:11,211 --> 00:05:14,087
appear to be using the gases as some form of fuel.

79
00:05:14,363 --> 00:05:16,969
Preliminary scans indicate that these devices

80
00:05:16,993 --> 00:05:19,142
are generating the strange energy emissions

81
00:05:19,153 --> 00:05:20,692
permeating the system.

82
00:05:21,378 --> 00:05:22,540
Captain’s log.

83
00:05:22,552 --> 00:05:24,701
Stardate 6048.4

84
00:05:25,577 --> 00:05:27,644
My analysis of the... uh...

85
00:05:27,937 --> 00:05:31,742
...alien devices surrounding Chorus 5
is producing some...

86
00:05:32,364 --> 00:05:34,301
...interesting results.

87
00:05:34,858 --> 00:05:38,181
More and more I’m starting to see
the relationship between...

88
00:05:38,736 --> 00:05:41,530
...the machines in orbit and the... uh...

89
00:05:41,531 --> 00:05:43,386
...gases in the atmosphere.

90
00:05:44,126 --> 00:05:45,934
If I can just gain...

91
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:48,148
...access to the internal systems...

92
00:05:48,606 --> 00:05:50,308
...of these machines...

93
00:05:50,428 --> 00:05:53,609
...I am certain that I would
be able to unlock their secret.

94
00:05:54,184 --> 00:05:56,075
I will continue to...

95
00:05:56,318 --> 00:05:57,774
...collect the data...

96
00:05:57,894 --> 00:05:59,942
...and work too hard
in high policies.

97
00:06:00,928 --> 00:06:02,654
Our mission to Chorus 5

98
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:05,127
...has shielded phenomenal results.

99
00:06:06,001 --> 00:06:08,655
I’ve learned more then I could have hoped for.

100
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:12,124
Everything is becoming clear!

101
00:06:12,688 --> 00:06:15,259
I realize my purpose, now.

102
00:06:15,379 --> 00:06:19,550
and I intend to see this experiment through
to the ultimate conclusion!

103
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:23,064
Nothing shall stand in my way! Nothing!

104
00:06:24,743 --> 00:06:26,351
That’s the last log entry.

105
00:06:26,704 --> 00:06:27,819
Thoughts?

106
00:06:27,831 --> 00:06:30,672
There was a clear change of personality,
if I ever saw one.

107
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:34,699
From increasing signs of stress and fatigue
to an obsessive nature.

108
00:06:35,267 --> 00:06:37,087
Did you noticed his eyes...

109
00:06:37,207 --> 00:06:39,159
...an almost red as glow.

110
00:06:39,418 --> 00:06:41,062
No tell in what’s affecting him.

111
00:06:41,182 --> 00:06:42,642
What state of mind he’s in?

112
00:06:42,762 --> 00:06:44,427
Or the rest of his crew!

113
00:06:44,547 --> 00:06:47,921
No one on that ship has made any attempt
to get a message to the Starfleet.

114
00:06:48,173 --> 00:06:49,958
And they’ve had plenty of opportunity.

115
00:06:49,968 --> 00:06:53,379
His attack on Farragut was deliberately
designed to put us out of commission,

116
00:06:53,499 --> 00:06:55,029
but not to destroy us.

117
00:06:55,344 --> 00:06:57,716
He want’s to delay us, and that’s all.

118
00:06:57,974 --> 00:07:00,906
- For what purpose?
- That alien technology.

119
00:07:01,328 --> 00:07:03,242
It looks like he was on to something.

120
00:07:03,362 --> 00:07:05,161
Maybe he just want
to buy a little more time.

121
00:07:05,607 --> 00:07:08,543
Why the strange behavior?
The sudden obsession?

122
00:07:08,663 --> 00:07:11,279
The abrupt disinterest on logging his progress?

123
00:07:11,767 --> 00:07:14,151
Could there be an alien force at work here?

124
00:07:14,503 --> 00:07:16,576
You mean something we haven’t seen on these logs?

125
00:07:17,198 --> 00:07:21,002
Well, I think he’d be giving something away
if he made contact with an alien presence.

126
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:24,266
I’m more inclined to believe
that those unusual energy vestige

127
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,886
may be responsible for his condition.

128
00:07:26,203 --> 00:07:29,256
Which could put Farragut at risk
as soon as we get on range.

129
00:07:29,678 --> 00:07:33,189
I want you to examine these logs
and associated data in more detail.

130
00:07:33,471 --> 00:07:35,855
See what you income out with before we get under way.

131
00:07:36,647 --> 00:07:39,659
Mr. Prescott,
Brief your men on the situation

132
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:42,254
and prepare them for
potential hostile encounter.

133
00:07:42,606 --> 00:07:45,934
We may need to beam aboard
the Azrael and take it by force.

134
00:07:46,054 --> 00:07:47,367
Very well, sir.

135
00:07:47,672 --> 00:07:48,776
Doctor,

136
00:07:48,799 --> 00:07:51,653
You can assist Comander Tacket
by analyzing that energy.

137
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:53,541
Find out if we’re at risk,

138
00:07:53,661 --> 00:07:55,786
and what you can do
to conter-act it’s effect.

139
00:07:56,097 --> 00:07:57,588
Hi, sir.

140
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:58,915
Dismissed.

141
00:08:04,082 --> 00:08:07,874
Remember that we are dealing
with another starfleet ship and crew.

142
00:08:07,994 --> 00:08:11,162
The attack on the Farragut
disabled our warp system only.

143
00:08:11,703 --> 00:08:13,946
No other damage was inflicted.

144
00:08:14,515 --> 00:08:17,556
As far as the crew as concern we can’t assume anything.

145
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:21,072
Whatever is driving their actions
cannot as yet be determined.

146
00:08:21,192 --> 00:08:23,813
But it appears to be causing
a progressive change.

147
00:08:24,177 --> 00:08:27,118
I’m counting on each of you to hold your emotions in check,

148
00:08:27,238 --> 00:08:29,995
and to fight any strange urge that you may experience.

149
00:08:30,847 --> 00:08:33,935
The captain may be setting us in to take control of the Azrael.

150
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:37,311
In the mean time we remain
on red alert readiness.

151
00:08:38,238 --> 00:08:39,729
Dismissed!

152
00:08:46,594 --> 00:08:49,002
It was an honor to serve
under you, Captain Glenn.

153
00:08:49,518 --> 00:08:51,632
I’ll never forget that
first training mission.

154
00:08:51,878 --> 00:08:53,440
I learned a lot from you.

155
00:08:53,771 --> 00:08:57,423
I was looking forward to seen you again and
reverencing all my time at the Academy.

156
00:09:07,694 --> 00:09:10,547
- How you’re coming, Mr. Galway?
- Almost there, sir.

157
00:09:11,886 --> 00:09:14,293
Just... one... more...

158
00:09:14,413 --> 00:09:15,621
Ouch!

159
00:09:15,633 --> 00:09:17,077
Are you OK?

160
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,709
Fine, sir.

161
00:09:18,829 --> 00:09:20,717
just a lapse in concentration.

162
00:09:21,556 --> 00:09:23,775
When I get a hold on that Captain Glenn,

163
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:25,924
he’s gonna be answering to me personally.

164
00:09:26,305 --> 00:09:29,699
For damage to the warp drive?
Or myself electrocution?

165
00:09:30,673 --> 00:09:32,140
Both!

166
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,346
I believe that does it.

167
00:09:42,186 --> 00:09:43,994
And at record time!

168
00:09:44,276 --> 00:09:46,142
Engineering to bridge.

169
00:09:46,395 --> 00:09:49,002
- Bridge here.
- We’re back online, captain.

170
00:09:49,236 --> 00:09:51,538
Full warp capability as in your command.

171
00:09:51,948 --> 00:09:53,099
Thanks, Mike!

172
00:09:53,314 --> 00:09:57,553
Mr. Taylor, lay in a course to
the Chorus system. Warp factor 6.

173
00:09:58,328 --> 00:10:00,656
- Course laid in, sir.
- Engage.
